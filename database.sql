Twitch streamers and their communities have raised millions of dollars each year for charitable causes, and have had an infinite amount of fun doing it. Whether it’s auctioning away retro games, dancing for twelve hours straight, or just staring at a wall, when it comes to charity our community always shows up. That’s why on this Giving Tuesday, we’re rallying our community to come together for good by hosting as many charity streams as possible – so we can help as many people as possible. We’re challenging every single streamer to host a charity stream anytime from 11/28 - 12/3 PT. Choose any nonprofit organization you wish to support using Twitch’s charity tool or Tiltify, and include #TogetherForGood or #Charity in your tags or stream title for a chance to be featured on Twitch’s homepage. All week, we’ll be featuring charity streams from streamers benefiting St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital®, and we have committed to matching the community’s donations up to $100,000. We’ll also be showcasing other incredible organizations like Movember, Games Done Quick, Cure Cancer’s Game On Cancer, Trans Lifeline, and many more. Plus, there’ll be custom Alerts to help you celebrate when your community donates using Twitch’s charity tool.

	('/en/2023/10/16/stories-on-twitch-stay-connected-with-your-community/','Oct 16, 2023 - By Eduardo Fenili, Sr. Product Manager. Stories on Twitch: Stay Connected with Your Community. I’m excited to announce the launch of stories on Twitch, a new feature in the Twitch mobile app that helps you stay connected with your community when you’re not live. I know you’re probably already familiar with the concept of stories. But by building stories into the Twitch experience, we’ve made it easier for you to reach your community directly on Twitch, through short posts that expire in 48 hours. You’ve built a loyal community on Twitch and your followers likely follow you on other platforms. But we’ve heard from you that trying to connect with them through multiple services limits your reach and can feel rather disconnected from your shared experiences on Twitch. Stories on Twitch makes it possible for you to quickly create and share content everyday to your Twitch community, where they are, on Twitch, using your mobile device. Starting today, all Twitch users with the latest version of the app installed will see the new stories shelf at the top of the Following page. Creating stories is currently limited to Partners & Affiliates who have had at least one stream in the last 30 days. Access to eligible streamers will roll out gradually by the end of the week and on an ongoing basis as streamers meet the minimum eligibility requirements. We may extend creation access to more streamers as we test the safety measures we have in place. Learn more about current eligibility requirements here. Whether you use it for stream updates, to share a picture from your vacation when you’re taking a much needed break, or just want to send positive vibes through an inspirational haiku you whipped up, use stories to keep your community engaged wherever you are. Reach your community on-the-go, in-one-go. One of the reasons we wanted to bring stories to Twitch is that it makes it possible for you to easily reach out to your Twitch followers. If your regularly scheduled stream will be starting 30 minutes late, you can let your community know with a story. If you&rsquo;re excited to share your feelings about the new streaming gear you just installed on your next stream, you can get your community excited to join through a story (and a photo of your amazing new setup). Push notifications will alert your followers when you’ve created a new story, and we’ve added stories-specific notification settings so your viewers can control how often they are notified. We’re initially launching stories to expire after 48 hours because we want to give your followers more time to see each unique post. Viewers will see your stories live alongside stories created by other streamers they follow, so post regularly throughout the week to keep your community in-the-know and up-to-date between your streams. We know how devoted and engaging communities on Twitch are so we’ve made it possible for viewers to show their support by reacting to your stories with emotes we’ve all come to love on Twitch. You’ll also be able to see total views and reaction counts on each story, even after they’ve expired, so you can see which stories resonated most with your community. Personalize stories to best represent you. Stories let you share photos, clips, or freeform content using text, custom channel emotes, and backgrounds. So if you want to share a great moment from your latest stream, you’ll be able to select a clip and easily relive the hype together or bring the viewers who missed your last stream up to speed. And remember, your stories don’t need to be all business. If you want to post a picture of your breakfast and spark a community debate about which cereals are S-tier, go for it. Encourage your viewers to participate through emote reactions to sound off on your story before the great cereal debate happens on the next stream. It’s all about staying in touch and deepening those connections, anytime you want. Welcome your newest subscribers. Streamers with at least 30 subscribers (including gift subs) will have the option to create sub-only stories. So in addition to existing sub benefits like custom emote access, sub badges, and ad-free viewing, posting sub-only stories is a great way to add even more value to your supporters’ subscriptions through exclusive content. Share a subs-only giveaway, let them pick the next game you stream by running a poll using reactions, give them a head start on when your next merch drop will be, or give exclusive behind-the-scenes content that they can’t see anywhere else. The possibilities are endless. Safely connecting with your community. Safety is factored into everything we build, so we want to roll stories out in a way that fosters a safe space for you and your community. In addition to the automated scanning measures we have in place to help prevent the upload of harmful content, we’ve also made it easy for you to keep each other safe. Content created and shared on stories will be held to the same Community Guidelines other content on Twitch is held to, and you can report stories that violate these standards directly within the app. What comes next? We’ll be adding more features in the coming months — a way for anyone interested in getting a feel for your community to find your story through your Channel page, mentions of other Twitch users, creating polls, uploading videos, clip editing capabilities, and more. Be sure to refresh the Twitch app and keep the latest version of the Twitch app installed. We’re excited to see how you use stories to showcase you and your community! Check it out, leave us feedback, and share your thoughts on which features you want to see next on UserVoice.

Have you ever dreamed what it would be like if Twitch chained together the biggest combo of live fighting game content the world has ever seen? Complete with your favorite streamers, exclusive giveaways, chances to be featured on the front page, merch prizes, and free guacamole, all culminating in the release of Street Fighter 6?

	('/en/2023/01/25/2023-an-open-letter-from-our-chief-product-officer-and-chief-monetization-officer/','Jan 25, 2023. 2023: An Open Letter from Our Chief Product Officer and Chief Monetization Officer. Hello, Twitch! My name is Tom Verrilli, and I’m the Chief Product Officer here at Twitch. My co-author today is Mike Minton, Chief Monetization Officer at Twitch. It’s the start of a new year, and in the spirit of new beginnings, we’d like to share some of our plans with you. You stream and build communities on our service, so we want to give you some more insight into what we’re doing to help you do what you do best. As Chief Product Officer, my team’s mission is to create tools and features that enable the community to easily create amazing content, and to ensure that content is found by viewers who will enjoy it. Our Monetization team is focused on helping streamers of all sizes earn income doing what they love, as well as reward and recognize viewers who support their favorite streamers. With our powers combined, we can give you the big picture view of what streamers can expect from us this year. First, let’s start with a recap of what Twitch launched for streamers in 2022. 2022 in Review. In 2022, we launched experiments and improved tools and features to help address some of the common pain points impeding your growth. We also launched a variety of products to help you make more money by using a mix of different monetization tools depending on where you are in your streaming journey.As a result, streamers earned over $1 billion across Twitch in 2022. These are some of the tools and changes that helped make all that possible: Lowering the payout threshold: We rolled out a lower $50 payout threshold — down from $100 — in over 130 countries and to 95% of monetizing streamers. This resulted in over 300,000 streamers getting their first payout, and 39% more streamers are now getting paid on a monthly basis compared to when we were at the $100 threshold.  Launching and updating Guest Star: To boost collaboration between streamers and help create new experiences with your community, you can now bring guests onto your stream quickly, easily, and without the risk of strikes. Post-launch updates to Guest Star included support for mobile, a viewer request mode, a dedicated homepage shelf, the ability to follow a guest without leaving the streamer’s channel, and a slew of security features for streamers and mods.  Making it easier to stand out and get discovered: We introduced customizable tags and tag-based collections to the homepage, experimented with a channel switcher that helped viewers try out new streamers, and launched Stream Schedules to help viewers keep track of your upcoming streams. Launching the Ads Incentive Program: This new program made it easier than ever for streamers to earn reliable income from ads. With a mid-year update that upped the ad rev split to 55%, the AIP has seen consistent opt-ins and strong results for streamers. Testing with Stream Display Ads: We began testing a less interruptive experience that limits how much of the video player shrinks when SDAs appear. Helping you understand what is and isn’t working in the content you stream: We recently made improvements to your Creator Dashboard analytics that empower you to make informed decisions. Category Suggestions highlight the categories that are popular with viewers but not yet widely streamed to. The Viewer Engagement Panel lets you see which moments in your stream drove the most engagement. And the Referral analytics graph experiment helps you understand how viewers find your channel from outside of Twitch. Making charity streams easier and more transparent: Our new built-in fundraising tool removed the hassle of supporting charitable causes on Twitch. Since launch, the number of charity streams has increased 250%, and the community has raised over $1 million using this tool. Rewarding viewers for supporting streamers: For SUBtember 2022, the global community showed up more than ever. To encourage even more support, we began offering viewers new rewards opportunities, like providing three months of Xbox PC Game Pass for new subs. Maximizing the impact of your community interactions: We’ve introduced new engagement tools to help you create meaningful connections with your viewers, whether they’re joining you for the first time or returning regulars. Chat Highlights and Community Introductions use real-time data about your live audience to create personalized interactions that help you connect with your viewers. Pinned Chat allows you to pin important messages for your viewers at the top of the chat so you don’t need to repeat information throughout your stream. 2023 Lookahead. Our main focus for the year is your growth — both for your communities and for your earnings on Twitch. In the first half of 2023, we’re launching products and tools that make it easier for you to earn without impacting growth, while also improving many of our existing products by expanding their capabilities so they can work harder for you. Giving you more options to earn. We’re focused on helping facilitate deeper community interaction and innovative viewer recognition. One of those experiences will be Sound Bites, our first-party sound alerts that allow viewers to pay to interact with and support their favorite streamers. Another will be an update to Cheering to give streamers the ability to recognize viewers in more personalized ways. We know that events like SUBtember have a positive impact on streamers’ earnings, so we’re building on this to find more ways to encourage your viewers to support your channel. In addition to our larger global moments, you’ll see more customized local initiatives that help boost support from your viewers and give you a chance to get extra prizes on top of that. We’re also experimenting with personalized discounts based on viewers’ behavior to better inspire streamer support. As a first step to building a meaningful sponsorship solution, we’ll test features with a select few streamers to make sponsorship deals more effective and authentic on Twitch, thereby making them more lucrative for the streamer and more impactful for the brand. Starting with channel skins and clickable branded graphics, streamers can easily place these brand assets onto streams, above chat, and other places on your channel page for a less disruptive and more engaging sponsorship experience. Once we land on the right solution, we’ll roll this out to more streamers. We’re bringing more of the tools that help viewers support you to our mobile experience, so that you can earn effectively across your community—no matter how they’re watching. New tools that reduce the effort to promote your stream on and off Twitch. Promoting your stream on other platforms is a key part of helping viewers discover your channel, but we know it can take hours of work to make promotional content from VODs and clips to share with your community. So we’re launching tools to help you edit and export your clips for vertical, short-form video formats and making it easier to promote your stream on other platforms by working with Twitter to improve how clips and live stream links play in the feed. We will be giving you more tools to help viewers discover your content, including: Pinned Clips, which will allow you to pin up to 20 clips to your channel page. These clips will give new viewers a better idea of what your stream is about, and will be fully at your discretion and include safety controls. Stream Title emotes will let you — wait for it — add emotes into your stream title. The Upcoming Streams section is coming to Twitch mobile apps. This will help viewers keep track of and tune in to streams for all the streamers they follow, all in one place. Making running ads easier and better for you. We’re updating the Ads Incentive Program to reflect requests from the community to make the program easier and more flexible. You can stay opted in once you’re in, and you’ll have more flexibility to adjust the number of ads you’re running. We’re also improving the ad running experience. We have heard from you all that it can be difficult to know when an ad is about to run, thereby making it difficult to prepare yourself and your community for the interruption. We will make changes to Ads Manager to help you have more visibility and control over when the ads roll. We know some viewers find value in an ad-free experience, so we’re working on making Twitch Turbo — which offers perks like ad-free viewing and chat upgrades to emotes and badges — better and more relevant for our community. We’re excited to share more updates later this year. Improving how and where ads show up on Twitch. In the first half of this year, we’re making two changes to improve the way ads work for viewers and channels: First, we’re updating the way disabling pre-rolls works for channels. Running three minutes of ads per hour in any way will disable all pre-rolls — they no longer have to be split into 90-second ads every 30 minutes. Second, we’re applying our Picture-by-Picture experience to the majority of pre-rolls that viewers do see. We’re also exploring ways to give communities a heads up when ads are coming and the ability to snooze video mid-roll ads. We will make it easier for you to flag to your community when you’re working with advertisers on branded content. Improving Guest Star with easier collaboration and customization. We’re rolling out browser support for Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari and launching more granular audio tooling for streamers who want more control over their guest’s audio (e.g. auto muting doubled sources, turning off echo cancellation for musical guests). Streamers have been playing together since Twitch was invented, spawning dozens of third party sites and even our own product. But fundamentally, these solutions were enhancements on having two tabs open at once — they didn’t allow the members of both communities to interact. Utilizing the technology we built for Guest Star, we’re going to experiment with experiences that will enable truly cross channel streaming experiences. Creating first party tools to better celebrate viewers. We’re focused on helping facilitate deeper community interaction and innovative viewer recognition. To help you engage with your viewers in better ways, we’re creating tools to help you celebrate moments of support from your community, making them more interactive and personalized. We’re working on developing unique alerts that you can only find on Twitch and will have more to share in the next few months. One of those experiences will be Sound Bites, our first-party sound alerts that allow viewers to pay to interact with and support their favorite streamers. Viewer Milestones will help you recognize viewers for hitting certain achievements during your stream, creating more personalized relationships with your viewers. Giving you better insight into what’s working and where there are opportunities to improve the content you stream. We’re rolling out Creator Home to all Affiliates and Partners, giving you a personalized, dynamic ‘homebase’ that surfaces the most relevant tips and actionable recommendations to help you grow, based on where you are on your streaming journey. We’re adding more analytics updates, including: Tag impression analytics that help you understand the number of viewers who saw your stream within a tag-filtered Browse page or in a Twitch search result for each tag. Data on the best days and times to stream in various games or categories to help you reach more viewers. Audience retention data so you can understand how you are engaging and retaining viewers. Helping you recognize and connect with your community, whether you’re live or offline. We know that many of you want the ability to stay in touch with your community even when you aren’t live, so we’re excited to launch a messaging product that allows you to send video and clip messages, targeted to your followers or subscribers, while you’re offline. We’re also building a Q&A tool to allow you to take prompts from their audience, with mod tools that will allow them to vet and approve the links before you show them on stream. Doubling down on discovery improvements that help viewers discover new content. We will expand on our 2022 launch of customizable tags that let streamers describe their stream in their own words by building the backend infrastructure to identify and collect streams related to the same topic (e.g. speedrunning), and feature these collections all over Twitch. We will also make these content collections browsable and persistent, which means you’ll be able to find the communities of streamers who stream using a custom tag with a fixed URL. We are introducing a new discovery feature on mobile that will allow viewers to seamlessly scroll through a feed of recommended channels and clips with ease. It’s perfect for viewers who are looking to discover new streamers when they have only a few minutes to spare. Going Forward. We love seeing what you can do when you’re enabled and empowered. We’re launching these features and tools because we want you to be able to build the communities you want to build, more easily and more reliably. Together, we can make Twitch better for all of us, so it’s important that we show up, tell you about what we’re working on, and get your input. We’ll also share updates more consistently to get you excited about what we’re building. This year, to help enable that feedback, we’re trying a few new things to help make those conversations easier and more frequent. First, we’ll be launching an experiments help page to give you more insight into some of the experiments we’re running on Twitch, whether you’re taking part in an experiment or not. We’re also committing to showing up on stream more to share regular updates and answer your questions. This list isn’t comprehensive, and we’ll share more details about what we’re working on when we can. In fact, tomorrow is our first Patch Notes of the year and we will be talking more live about what we’ve shared here. Come join us on twitch.tv/twitch at 12 noon PT, and we’ll see you in chat.',2357,'2023: An Open Letter from Our Chief Product Officer and Chief Monetization Officer','

Whether it’s playing a new title on release day or throwing it back to a classic for all the nostalgia feels, it’s crucial to have that game library available when you want it. So, we want to help. For a limited time, we’re teaming up with Xbox to provide a PC Game Pass trial when you support Twitch streamers with subscriptions! From November 3 at 10 AM PT until November 11 at 3 PM PT, you’ll get 3 months of PC Game Pass (valid for new Game Pass members only) when you purchase two new Twitch subs and/or gift subs.*.

	('/en/2022/05/19/celebrating-one-in-a-billion-talent-for-gaad/','May 19, 2022. Celebrating One in a Billion Talent for GAAD. Update 5/19: This post was revised to address a mistake regarding an accessibility tip. Say it with us: accessibility for all! Today, for Global Accessibility Awareness Day, let’s celebrate this mission as one Twitch community. All day long, creators will be leading this charge on our homepage by showing off their skills, talking about the importance of digital accessibility, answering your questions, and also just having a great time. Plus, we’ll tell you a bit more about what we’re doing to boost accessibility on Twitch, and what you — yes, you — can do to help. GAAD is a wonderful thing. But its goal of accessibility for all can’t just be relegated to one group of people. In fact, about 15% of all people in the world are living with a disability. That’s over 1 billion people. Which, last time we checked, is a lot. Accessibility is not a problem for the few, but for the (very) many. And the more steps we can all take toward that goal, the better. Thankfully, of that 1+ billion folks, some of the kindest, most talented, and most entertaining people have built their communities right here on Twitch. Their knowledge and expertise, and their contributions to gaming, art, and more, are streaming live not just today but every day. If you’re looking for them, look no further. Here’s the full lineup of the amazing creators going live on the Twitch homepage for GAAD: 8 AM Pacific: /TiffanyWitcher. 10 AM Pacific: /DynamicReactions. 12 Noon Pacific: /CoinFuryTV. 2 PM Pacific: /jtownholla. 4 PM Pacific: /CocoConfession. 5 PM Pacific: /Nikatine. 6 PM Pacific: /CookingWithoutLooking. 7 PM Pacific: /Imakuni. 8 PM Pacific: /Imperial. For Australia and New Zealand regions, keep an eye on the ANZ Front Page for these local creators up until May 22nd: /Akari, /Beri, /BlazePlayyz, /Caddlebear, /ChaiLatteNebula, /magnetbrain, /Morrow_Plays, /NoHandsNZ, /Nyaadia, /Octarock, and /pwuppygf. What else we’re doing While everyone is doing their part in promoting accessibility awareness, we have some updates to share, too. Here are some initiatives, both internal to Twitch and external for the whole community, that we’ve recently completed, begun, or have in the works. In early 2022, we began working with accessibility consultants, with and without lived experience of disability, to review our applications from an accessibility angle. We’ve reviewed the Creator Stream Manager dashboard on web, mobile apps, and our core UI library — with more audits coming this year. Our internal teams are using these reports to improve Twitch’s accessibility across the board. We’re planning to conduct employee training in web accessibility for tech groups across Twitch, including product managers, designers, UX researchers, and software engineers, with a target date of June 2022. We’re in the process of establishing partnerships with external accessibility consulting organizations for conducting qualitative user research of Twitch experiences including people with disabilities. To promote user centered design, we created an annotation library that designers use to communicate accessibility design decisions with developers easily. We started including annotations to communicate heading structure, image alternative text and page titles as part of our design review process, and will be expanding the library to include more annotation options. Several accessibility improvements are currently in the works, including: Making it easier for creators to recognize when their viewers have a limited channel experience so they can make adjustments to their stream. This includes a chat badge that lets viewers self identify as audio- or video-only. Reducing the amount of time and effort it takes to navigate the Twitch site using a keyboard. This includes getting to specific sections of the page quickly, cutting down on the number of tab presses or redundant links it takes to get from place to place. Making it easier for those using screen readers to participate in chat, both by providing user preference to alter functionality when the chat window is in focus, and by using skip links that can be used to avoid reading every chat message if the user is ready to send a message. How you can help In addition to watching and supporting the creators above, there are plenty of things you can do to promote accessibility on Twitch and beyond. If you’re a creator, take 20 minutes and help make your stream more accessible for everyone by making a few simple changes: Use closed captions. Consider adding closed captions to your streams using Guide to Closed Captions. Activate subtitles in games. Many modern games also offer options to increase subtitle size, adjust the text color and font, and more. We have a whole Creator Camp article about making your channel more accessible, with input from /BlindGamerSteve, /Nikatine, and /NoHandsNZ, so check it out! In no time at all, you can make your channel more welcoming than ever. If you’re not a creator (but this also applies if you are), you could also take some time to educate yourself (and your community!) about ableist language, how it affects people living with disabilities, and some alternatives to use that keep accessibility in mind: Harvard Business Review: Why You Need to Stop Using These Words and Phrases. BBC: The harmful ableist language you unknowingly use. Stanford University: Disability Language Guide. Whether you’re a viewer or a streamer, a person with a disability or not, a chatter or a lurker — however you help boost awareness is important, so thank you for your support. And for any accessibility related questions and feedback, email accessibility@twitch.tv! We’ll see you in chat.',920,'Celebrating One in a Billion Talent for GAAD','

Today, let’s officially celebrate the hardest working folks in chat. The ones who play a beloved and irreplaceable role in supporting creators and growing the communities you love. Twitch is a global community, so Mod Appreciation Day is a worldwide event. That means no matter where (or when) you are, you’re invited to celebrate. Mod Appreciation Day kicks off the morning of March 31 in the US, but for folks in APAC countries, it will already be April 1. New Global Emote. Mods are beloved by Twitch creators, communities, and everyone in between. Twitch wouldn’t be the same without them. The next time you want to show your appreciation for a mod, consider typing ModLove in chat. ooooh, ahhhh. Created by DREAM_OW, ModLove is available now for anyone who’d like to use it! We highly recommend shouting out your favorite Mods, and this emote will help make your message extra special. Mod Love Competition Winners! A few weeks ago we kicked off the Mod Love Competition and invited Partners and Affiliates to sing their Mods’ praises to the whole wide internet. At stake: two $2500, three-day trips to TwitchCon San Diego, plus thousands in Twitch gift cards. Your response has been absolutely mod-umental, and we’ve had a blast going through your submissions. Unfortunately we don’t have time to show them all, but we’ve put together a mod-tage (sorry, that’s the last time) of mod love for your enjoyment. Check it out! Of course, now that the competition is over it’s also time to announce the winners. You can make a drum roll sound on the table if you’d like. The winners of the Creator + Mod trip for two to TwitchCon San Diego are: /sophtoph and ytxpikachu! Congratulations, and we’ll see you both in San Diego this October! 100 other Mods will be receiving $250 in Twitch gift cards, so thank you to everyone who participated in showing maximum Mod love. New Mod Feature: /announce. Moderators’ mighty swords certainly catch your eye in chat, but even their green badge of honor can get lost in the mix when chat is packed with emotes or flying by at warp speed. Sometimes Mods need to make important announcements, celebrate a stream milestone, or just get chat’s attention. To help Mods do the work they need to do, we’re releasing a new command: /announce. By using the /announce command, Mods and Creators will be able to highlight their messages so they’ll stand out boldly in chat. There are four default border colors, but Mods can also use the color designated by the creator instead. This was a highly requested community feature, and your feedback was instrumental in getting this on our radar. We’re thrilled to /announce that it’s available today! Creator Camp Mod Update. In tandem with Mod Appreciation Day, we’ve updated the Creator Camp Moderation and Safety section. Learn more about why it’s important for creators to have a strategy for their mods about moderating their community, as well as advice on how moderators can work with creators on identifying and playing to their strengths. What tips do you have for new and current moderators? Onward! Mod Appreciation Day is only one day long, but this community’s appreciation for what you do lasts 24/7/365. From everyone at Twitch and everyone in chat: thank you! You make the internet a better place. As always, we’ll be listening to your suggestions for ways to make Twitch safer. If you have any feedback on the new /announce feature, or any other feature for that matter, you know where to find us.',611,'Raise Your Swords for Mod Appreciation Day','

	('/en/2021/09/08/ready--set--goals-rally-the-squad-with-new-creator-goals/','Sep 8, 2021. Ready. Set. Goals! Rally the Squad with New Creator Goals. As a creator, it’s always helpful to call your shot. Clearly communicating your intention to reach a follower or sub goal is the first step towards both achieving that goal and building a community along the way. But you don’t want to be repeating yourself over and over every stream. So, how do you ensure your goals are clear and trackable for all to see? The answer is Twitch’s newest feature: Creator Goals. Whether you’re celebrating a Partnerversary with a subathon or saving for a new mic to level up your audio, Creator Goals is a powerful new way to publicly launch and track those goals on Twitch. Now, with just a few clicks, creators can launch and display follower and sub goals on their channels. Maximize the visibility of ongoing goals to let your community know their status in real-time. Reaching goals doesn’t just benefit you, it also benefits your community. Custom and animated emotes, ad-free viewing (when enabled), loyalty badges and more are all on the table for subs once you progress to Affiliate and Partner status. Easy to Use & Specific to You. Creator Goals is designed with simplicity in mind so you can remain focused on creating your best content. Launch a sub goal from Stream Manager by enabling the “Manage Goal” Quick Action, in Twitch Studio by adding a goal as a layer, or by using the “/goal” chat command. Creator Goals also helps creators just beginning their streaming journey with follower goals. Setting follower goals adds visibility to your ongoing efforts to grow your audience as you master the art of engaging viewers and creating a community. To launch a follower goal, simply select the “Manage Goal” Quick Action and choose “Follower Goal” from the options. Follower goals are an excellent way to highlight the grind to Affiliate status while complementing tune-in messaging on social networks. (Check out Creator Camp for more pointers on growing your channel.). Taking the Guesswork Out of Goals. To make it easier for creators to set goals that are right for them, Twitch will recommend goals based on a creator’s current sub point or follower count. Goal recommendations are designed to help creators reach their next recognizable milestone. For example, if a creator has 11 subs, Twitch will recommend they go for 20. If a creator has 260 followers, Twitch will recommend they reach for 300. Think you can reach higher or want to set a less ambitious goal? Simply edit the recommended goal higher or lower to make it your own. Creators can also customize the goal description to ensure viewers understand them clearly. Rally the Squad. Creator Goals helps creators reach their objective by showing viewers the real-time, cumulative impact of their support. This feature is completely automated and launched whenever you start a new goal. Goals will remain active in a channel until the creator deletes them or starts a new one, meaning creators only have to set a goal once even if it takes them a few live streams to complete. Best of all, everyone watching your channel will see how close they are to reaching each goal. When’s the best time to enable Creator Goals on your channels? Right now! The recent launch of local subscription prices around the world and the upcoming SUBtember promotion are great opportunities to engage with your viewers and start building communities together. ENABLE A GOAL NOW. Developers - Creator Goals is coming to the Twitch API and EventSub! We kicked off our closed beta to gather initial feedback before we transition into an open beta in the near future. During this time, the developer documentation will be updated so you can begin brainstorming how to integrate Creator Goals into your third-party applications for the Twitch community. Learn more about how to enable Creator Goals on a channel in this Help Article. We’re just getting started with Creator Goals and will continue to add the features creators need to reach higher goals. As always, we look forward to hearing your feedback.

	('/en/2021/08/05/local-sub-pricing-expands-worldwide/','Aug 5, 2021. Local Sub Pricing Expands Worldwide. UPDATE: Local sub pricing is available to all viewers in Europe. UPDATE: As of July 29, 2021 local sub pricing is available to all viewers in the Middle East and Africa regions. UPDATE: As of July 27, 2021 local sub pricing is available to all viewers in the Latin America region. UPDATE: Since we launched local sub pricing in Mexico and Turkey, the way viewers in those countries have rallied around their favorite creators has blown us away. Compared to the three months prior to local sub pricing, viewers are gifting five times more subs. More creators are earning sub revenue now, and more viewers overall are supporting their favorite channels. In short, lower subscription prices are helping creators and viewers build vibrant communities together! These results confirm to us that lower prices help subscribers grow. We’re excited to announce that we’ll start rolling out local sub pricing to more regions across the world. We’ll first start with most of our communities in the Asia Pacific region within the next week. Our goal is to introduce this pricing update to all countries slated to get a price reduction within the next month. We will update the community on this blog and social media as we launch prices in new regions. Below is a partial list of the Tier 1 subscription price changes on Web in selected countries in the Asia Pacific region. For a full list of price changes in Asia Pacific countries, read more here. Local Sub Pricing in Asia Pacific Countries. Country. Previous Price. New Price. % Decrease. Australia. 8.99 AUD. 7.99 AUD. 11% New Zealand. 9.99 NZD. 7.99 NZD. 20% Taiwan. 149 TWD. 77 TWD. 48% Korea. 6,600 KRW. 5,000 KRW. 24% Thailand. 160 THB. 69 THB. 57% Singapore. 7 SGD. 4.49 SGD. 36% As always, we look forward to hearing your feedback on this important change. Should you have any suggestions or questions, let us know at help.twitch.tv. Learn more about Local Subscription Pricing and find additional resources here. Subs are awesome. When that subscriber alert pings, Chat pops off with HeyGuys and custom emotes, and creators can’t help but give a warm shout of appreciation. It’s the kind of bleedPurple show of support that makes this community so amazing. But beyond that moment of hype, subscribing means something even more. It’s long term support for streamers and their content—a vote to keep going and keep creating. It’s unlocking new emotes and representing a community everywhere on Twitch. It’s having an important part in building a community to be proud of. Here’s the thing, though: we’ve heard from fans everywhere that it’s not equally affordable around the world to show support, access custom emotes, and enjoy all the other benefits that come with being a subscriber. That’s because the price of a Tier 1 subscription on the web is roughly the equivalent of $4.99 USD in every country. This price makes it difficult for many viewers to support their favorite creators, and likewise, prevents creators from being able to grow their communities, make more content, and welcome new fans. This isn’t just anecdotal; it’s reflected clearly in the numbers. The percentage of active users in Europe or Asia who support creators with a subscription is roughly 50% lower relative to North America. In Latin America, it’s nearly 80% lower. It’s time for subscription pricing that’s adjusted for where viewers live. Prices that make it so more people than ever can feel comfortable showing their support and enjoying the benefits of a subscription. Read on to learn more about local subscription pricing, when it’s coming, which countries are up first, how we’re supporting creators through these changes, how to give us feedback, and more. Introducing Local Subscription Pricing Over the next few months, we’ll be adjusting the price of subscriptions (existing subs, new paid subs, and gift subs) in most countries to better align with their local cost of living. First up will be Mexico and Turkey on May 20, 2021, which are home to creators and viewers who have been passionate about this change for quite some time. Mexico and Turkey will be followed by most countries in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe starting in Q3 2021. This gradual rollout will help the community adjust more smoothly to such an impactful change. We’ll continue to update the community as we ready more countries and regions for the price change rollout. The most important thing to take away here is that subscription prices in the vast majority of countries outside of the US will be lowered. For a full list of impacted countries, go here. A viewer’s subscription price will be based on where they live and have set up their Twitch payment method. We have designed this pricing model to ensure that prices are appropriately set for viewers, wherever they live. For creators this means that some viewers in their channels may see different prices. This change will make it easier for creators everywhere to grow their communities, while making it more affordable for viewers to show their support and access subscriber benefits like ad-free viewing (when enabled by the creator), custom channel emotes, sub tenure badges, Channel Point multipliers, and sub-only chat mode. The Results Are In. There are two main reasons driving local price changes. First is that viewers have let us know they want to be able to support creators and help grow their favorite communities, no matter where they live. And second is that creators will benefit from the price reduction in the long-term as subscriptions become more affordable for viewers around the world. Prior to making this decision, we conducted several price tests and saw that lower sub prices boosted overall monthly subs and sub revenue for creators. In one recent test in Brazil, lower sub prices more than doubled creator revenue and total subscriber count. Newly released Twitch promotions for first time subscribers and first time gifters have shown revenue increases in Latin America and Europe as well. Supporting Creators Through the Changes. Creator revenue is obviously really important, and we’ve kept them front of mind with every decision we’ve made. Across the board, our tests clearly showed making subs more affordable for more viewers boosts creator revenue. However, the fact remains that these were tests, and when we are making changes that could affect creator revenue, we don’t want to leave any stone unturned. We’re confident lower sub prices will boost creator growth and revenue in the long-term, but we knew we also had to minimize potential dips in creator revenue during this early adjustment period. To help creators adapt to the new pricing model with no impact to their short-term subscription revenue, we’re launching a 12-month program that guarantees a certain level of revenue for eligible creators. Here’s how the program works. We highly recommend you read the complete details regarding terms and eligibility here. Twitch will cover 100% of baseline channel and Prime sub revenue (if needed) for three calendar months, including the month of the price change. After that, we will slowly decrease incentive payments by 25% every three months over the following 9 months, totaling a 12-month period of providing revenue adjustment incentives. It all starts with “baselines.” Basically, we’ll take a look at how much money a creator has made from paid and prime subs in the last three months, as well as how many hours were streamed live, and calculate averages. These averaged baseline stats will be visible in the Creator Dashboard for eligible creators in countries where the price has changed. As long as that creator streams at least 85% of their live baseline hours in a month and meets certain other eligibility criteria, we’ll pay that creator a “revenue adjustment incentive” to make up for any lost revenue from subs. When creators out-perform their average – i.e. get more subs revenue – they will receive that increased amount, not the incentive payment, but may be eligible for future months should they need it. Once local sub pricing begins rolling out, eligible creators will be able to use their Creator Dashboard to view their monthly baseline amounts, actual subscription revenue, and upcoming streaming requirements. Creators, Get Ready! As part of our efforts to help creators grow and build communities, we’ll be launching promotional campaigns in countries all around the world reminding viewers of the sub price change in their country. To take advantage of this increased awareness, it’s critical that creators do their part to make sure their communities know about the new lower sub pricing. One great way to do this is by announcing the update live on your stream. This is also a great time to level up a channel by adding more emotes to available emote slots or running sub goals to unlock even more. And as always, there are more tips on how to build a community on Creator Camp. For more resources to help amplify the news, check out the Help Article. First Up: Mexico and Turkey As mentioned above, the new pricing program will debut first in Mexico and Turkey on May 20, 2021. The new Tier 1 prices in Turkey (9.90 TRY) and Mexico (48 Pesos) reflect significant price reductions and we’re excited to see the community rally behind their favorite creators. This gradual rollout will help make sure we give the community a seamless and successful experience, and we’ll keep you updated with progress and next steps.

We’re often asked “what’s next for Twitch?” but the truth is that streamers and developers in the Twitch Community have always been the ones pushing Twitch forward. To help kickstart the next decade of groundbreaking ideas, we’re launching Twitch Past-Forward Grants to help streamers and developers bring their content and product ideas to life. So if you have an idea you’ve wanted to try, but need a bit of financial support to make it happen, all you need to do is submit a video three minutes or less in length describing your idea and vision for a chance to work directly with Twitch to make it a reality. We’ll be awarding $10,000 to a winner in each of the following categories: Content - Gaming: Do you have a new idea for taking gaming streams to the next level? Is there a tabletop game show or vtuber concept you’d test if you have a little support? Content - Creative: Musicians, MakeUp Artists, Body Painters, Makers & Crafters, and Food & Drink streamers: do you have a project or DIY format you’d be able to experiment with if you had a little bit of budget? Content - Other: Podcasts, Travel & Outdoor, Just Chatting, and other non-gaming/non-creative streams have almost limitless opportunities. We’re here to help bring your ideas to life! Devs - Extensions: Extensions offer a boost to the viewer experience and we’d love to help developers get the financial support needed to offer new or upgraded extensions to our creators and viewers. Devs - Twitch-Integrated Games: Are you a game developer who wants to further integrate Twitch viewers and streamers into your game’s experience? We want to hear what you have planned and help make it happen! Entries will be accepted from users in the United States and the District of Columbia, Canada (excluding residents of Quebec), the European Union, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom starting at 12:01 am Pacific Time on July 30, 2021 through 11:59 pm PT on August 30. You can read the full list of Official Rules here and submit your application and three minute video here. Winners will be announced on or around September 17, 2021 in this blog post and on the September Twitch Public Access show.

	('/en/2021/07/02/twitch-api-and-eventsub-summer-recap-for-2021/','Jul 2, 2021 - By Jon Bulava. Twitch API and EventSub Summer Recap for 2021. It has been a productive year for the Twitch API and EventSub. A number of highly-requested endpoints, features, and real-time events have been added to these products for developers to build anything from immersive game integrations to creative audience engagement tools. We wanted to take a few minutes to recap the functionality that has been added in the first half of 2021 just to make sure developers are aware of all the latest updates! As a reminder, you can subscribe to notifications for all the latest Twitch Developer news via the announcements category on the forums. Channel Stream Schedule API. Let’s begin with the most recent release – the Channel Stream Schedule API. Since the announcement of the channel stream schedule, developers have been inquiring about the possibility of API endpoints to interface with this new feature so it could be built into existing third-party creator workflows. With over 150 votes on UserVoice and with an obvious benefit for creators and viewers alike to further adopt the product, the suggestion was turned into a reality. Go to the documentation: Get Channel Stream Schedule. Get Channel iCalendar. Update Channel Stream Schedule. Create Channel Stream Schedule Segment. Update Channel Stream Schedule Segment. Delete Channel Stream Schedule Segment. Twitch Emotes API. Previously only available in v5 of the Twitch API, endpoints to retrieve Twitch Emotes have also been a highly-requested addition. The latest version of the API now supports methods to retrieve emotes for a specific channel, global emotes, and specific emote sets. The channel emotes include all custom images for subscribers, Bits tiers, and followers. These endpoints will be quite helpful for completely migrating to the latest version of the API. Go to the documentation: Get Channel Emotes. Get Global Emotes. Get Emote Sets. Chat Badges API. Similar to Twitch Emotes, chat badges were another chat-related feature developers wanted to see as Helix endpoints. These images are the decorators that a Twitch viewer can select to be next to their username in chat to customize how they appear to other viewers. These endpoints can be used to retrieve the custom chat badges for a channel or those that are globally available across Twitch. Go to the documentation: Get Channel Chat Badges. Get Global Chat Badges. Polls and Channel Points Predictions API. The UserVoice suggestions for Polls and Predictions APIs had almost 400 votes from developers combined. These are two of the most popular community engagement tools for Twitch Partners and Affiliates. Polls are a fun, lightweight interaction that everyone on a channel can participate in to quickly identify viewer sentiment and make choices that impact stream content. Predictions allow viewers to use their Channel Points to back one of two forecasted options, with the chance to win points from the pool if their guess is correct. By providing a programmatic way to manage Polls and Predictions, developers can leverage their innovation and creativity to provide a wide range of unique interactive experiences for the Twitch community. Go to the documentation: Get Polls. Create Poll. End Poll. Get Predictions. Create Prediction. End Prediction. Teams API. Twitch Teams is a great way to unite creators and provides a discovery mechanism for viewers to find content with a similar theme. We’re glad to continue this functionality from v5 of the Twitch API. Go to the documentation: Get Channel Teams. Get Teams. Moderation-related APIs. A number of API endpoints have been added this year for developers building tools for channel moderation. The Twitch API now supports the ability to manage a user’s block list as well as manage AutoMod messages that have been held for review. Go to the documentation: Manage Held AutoMod Messages. Get User Block List. Block User. Unblock User. Miscellaneous APIs. In addition to all of the endpoints already mentioned, there were a number of other highly-requested endpoints that are now part of the latest version of the Twitch API. This functionality includes checking a user’s subscription status for a channel, retrieving live stream information for the channels a user follows, retrieving channel editor information, and deleting videos. Go to the documentation: Check User Subscription. Get Followed Streams. Get Channel Editors. Delete Videos. Payload Additions. API endpoints weren’t the only addition to the Twitch API. There were also updates to existing API payloads to include important details for third-party integrations. Below is a list of endpoints that received additional fields requested by the community. Get Broadcaster Subscriptions – total subscription count added to the response. Get Channel Information – delay added to the response and to the optional fields for modifying a channel. Get Streams – is_mature flagadded to the response. Get Clips – duration in seconds added to the response. Search Channels – game_name added to the response. Get Videos – stream_id added to the response. Get Videos – muted_segments added to the response; an array of objects with duration and offset. broadcaster_login and/or user_login were added to more than 15 existing API endpoints that already returned user ID and display name. EventSub Rate Limit Strategy and Subscription Types. If you’re interested in receiving real-time notification for Twitch events, EventSub is the product to supplement your use of the Twitch API. This year, the team was able to use feedback from a request for comments to implement a new rate limiting strategy based on authorizations. This new system allows your application to grow with your users’ growth as they authorize your application; a great improvement over the previous static rate limit applied to all applications. And of course, new EventSub subscription types were added over the last six months to supplement all of the new Twitch API endpoints already mentioned and more. Go to the documentation: Channel Moderator Add. Channel Moderator Remove. Channel Poll Begin. Channel Poll Progress. Channel Poll End. Channel Prediction Begin. Channel Prediction Progress. Channel Prediction Lock. Channel Prediction End. Channel Raid. Channel Subscription End. Channel Subscription Gift. Channel Subscription Message. Extension Bits Transaction Create. Thanks for your feedback. Much of these updates were the direct result of developer feedback provided in our quarterly surveys. We greatly appreciate your time and input, which provides us with a holistic view of the community and greater insight as to how our efforts should be prioritized. With that in mind, our next quarterly survey is open now that we have reached the halfway point for 2021! Let us know how we’re doing and how we can improve the developer experience at your convenience. Thanks again – we look forward to bringing you even more features in the second half of the year.

	('/en/2021/05/24/polls-and-channel-points-predictions-have-leveled-up-with-twitch-api-and-eventsub-support/','May 24, 2021 - By Jon Bulava. Polls and Channel Points Predictions have leveled up with Twitch API and EventSub support. Polls and Channel Points Predictions are two of our most popular community engagement tools for Twitch Partners and Affiliates. Polls — used to quickly identify viewer sentiment and make choices that impact stream content — are a fun, lightweight interaction that everyone on a channel can participate in. From our most hardcore viewers, who want a say in upcoming gameplay, to lurkers who enjoy the anonymous interaction, Polls appeal to a wide range of viewers and help creators keep their content fresh and relevant. Predictions allow viewers to use their Channel Points to back one of two forecasted options, with the chance to win points from the pool if their guess is correct. Since the feature’s debut in December 2020, millions of viewers each week have put their points behind the blue side or the pink side (or as we’ve seen many times — Believers or Doubters). Running a Prediction during a high-stakes moment is sure to get Chat going, especially as temporary badges help viewers identify their team and spur light rivalry. Now that Polls and Channel Points Predictions have become an integral part of the broadcasting and viewing experience, we’re pleased to make this functionality generally available through the Twitch API and EventSub as of today. By providing a programmatic way to manage Polls and Predictions, developers can leverage their innovation and creativity to provide a wide range of unique interactive experiences for the Twitch community. Developers and broadcasters will certainly discover more ways to take advantage of these APIs than we can imagine, and that’s part of the excitement. To make sure these new APIs were reliable and met the community’s expectations, we released this functionality earlier this month as a public beta. During this timeframe, developers were able to familiarize themselves with the endpoints and provide feedback regarding any changes or future improvements to consider. Let’s take a look at some ideas that have popped up. An unofficial statistic we like to use around here is TTM, or “Time To Minecraft.” When new Twitch developer products become available, they are inevitably integrated into Minecraft quite quickly, and the Polls and Predictions APIs were no exception. Here’s a great example from thefyrewire that shows how Polls can be leveraged programmatically for an audience to affect in-game events. With the new @TwitchDev Polls API, polls now automatically pop in chat at random intervals, so chat can decide what pain to inflict on me in Minecraft 😢🐝 pic.twitter.com/9KieUJodC4. — thefyrewire 🐙 (@MikeyHay) May 7, 2021. Programmatic Channel Points Predictions can be very useful as well for providing a deeper immersion and friendly competition among viewers. Take this Tweet from therealhellcat for example. This will SO be implemented in #ViewergamesArcade 😀 Thinking of map votes and predictions on game outcomes 😎👍 — = HELLCAT = (@therealhellcat) May 4, 2021. Viewergames Arcade is a racing game designed to be played with the broadcaster’s audience, so being able to predict winning outcomes only fuels this friendly competition more and keeps the audience engaged. It’s easy to see how this idea can be applied more broadly; imagine game developers programmatically starting a Prediction when the broadcaster enters a boss battle or when the game detects the broadcaster is close to fulfilling an achievement. These are ideas that broadcasters and their communities have been able to dream up in just the first few weeks of the public beta. We can’t even imagine what you will build in the coming months and years. To start developing with Polls and Predictions, refer to the API reference for actions like starting a poll, and refer to the new EventSub subscription types to receive related events as they occur. And we continue to welcome your feedback via the developer category on UserVoice. While we cannot predict exactly what you’re going to build, we unequivocally know that the Polls and Predictions APIs will help you deliver some of the most clever and unique interactive experiences for the Twitch community.',681,'Polls and Channel Points Predictions have leveled up with Twitch API and EventSub support','

	('/en/2021/02/01/celebrate-black-brilliance-on-twitch/','Feb 1, 2021. Celebrate Black Brilliance on Twitch. History doesn’t just happen. It’s created. And Black Streamers are creating it live every day. For years Black Creators have played a pivotal role in cultivating a dynamic and dedicated community not just on Twitch, but within gaming as a whole. They are gamers like deejayknight and cupahnoodle. They are creatives like Imperial and urbanbohemian. They are hosts and commentators like SpawnOnMe. But most importantly they are Creators. They create streams that entertain, captivating storylines in D&D, podcasts that inform, and much more all while pushing the boundaries of online spaces. So this Black History Month, we want to celebrate Black Brilliance by honoring, uplifting, and recognizing the Black Creators who shape gaming culture and beyond everytime they go live. Joining us are 30 featured creators and over 100 others to discover through our Black Brilliance Recommended Section on the Front Page. We’re also broadcasting original programming featuring some of the most prominent Black voices across gaming. This includes a custom video series dedicated to Black creators, the Black Indie Developer Showcase, and the HBCU Esports League. Our goal is for everyone to have a safe, celebratory experience that introduces viewers to some awesome communities. We know more visibility can sometimes lead to unwanted trolling and harassment so we’re offering sessions on mod tools, best practices, and more to every creator participating in our Black History Month celebration. We’ve also implemented a clear escalation process for any creator in need of more support. Now, here’s a look at who and what is going live when: | 2/1 | 9:00 AM KangGaming | | 2/2 | 12:00 PM MiladyConfetti | | 2/3 | 4:00 PM PleasantlyTwstd | | 2/4 | 3:00 PM KarimCheese | | 2/5 | 11:00 AM CriticalBard | | 2/5 | 4:00 PM VNogi | | 2/6 | 4:00 PM Kalamity | | 2/7 | 5:00 AM urbanbohemian | | 2/8 | 6:00 PM MissJourdy | | 2/9 | 3:00 PM xraypc | | 2/9 | 6:00 PM SpawnOnMe | | 2/10 | 11:00 AM TKbreezy | | 2/12 | 4:00 PM sixyBB | | 2/13 | 10:00 AM BadGalShay | | 2/14 | 1:00 PM AlexisAyeee | | 2/15 | 2:00 PM educated_collins | | 2/16 | 3:00 PM PikaChulita | | 2/17 | 2:00 PM Cupahnoodle | | 2/18 | 4:00 PM codergirlchan | | 2/19 | 2:00 PM uhmaayyze | | 2/20 | 6:00 PM Zombaekillz | | 2/20 | 8:00 PM JennaSaisQuoi | | 2/21 | 9:00 AM kingjae | | 2/21 | 4:00 PM Paccman630 | | 2/22 | 5:00 PM SenseiCJ | | 2/23 | 5:00 PM BlaqMario | | 2/24 | 7:00 AM mspinky313 | | 2/25 | 6:00 AM BrownGirlGamerCode | | 2/26 | 3:00 PM IntelligameUS | | 2/27 | 8:00 PM BigCheeseKIT | | 2/28 | 12:00 PM Nolay | (All times PST).

Every week this February we’ll invite Black luminaries from the world of game and hardware development to be guests on /twitchgaming’s The Weekly. They’ll discuss representation in gaming, barriers that have been removed, and those that remain. Black Creator Summit - Thursday, February 18th. We believe it’s important to amplify black voices, and to actively listen to them as well. That’s why on February 18th we’re inviting twelve streamers to participate in our Black Brilliance Summit. They’ll speak with Twitch staff about product and safety improvements, hear directly from Twitch COO Sara Clemens on the current state of Twitch, and get insights on streaming tactics. Black Indie Developer Showcase - Thursday, Feb 25 @ TIME TBD on /twitchgaming. We’re teaming up with The Mix to produce a live show featuring a vast network of indie developers. Game devs will discuss current projects, offer sneak peaks, and talk about the ecosystem of the independent gaming world. HBCU Esports League - Sundays @ TIME TBD on /cxmmunityco A partnership between Twitch and Cxmmunity, a non-profit run by HBCU alumni that focuses on STEAM/STEM learning and career development through gaming and esports. Matches are Sundays and Wednesdays on /cxmmunityco and will be featured on the Twitch Front Page. Be sure to tune into the Celebrity Pro-Am event on Feb 21. Black History Month is a time to celebrate, but it’s also a chance for all of us to be better allies and do more to fight against systemic racism and injustice. That work must continue every single day, both on and off Twitch. On our end we’ve been focused on four key areas: Exposure: To further recognize the crucial role they’ve played in Twitch and gaming culture, we’re committed to highlighting and promoting Black creators across Twitch. Over the last several months we’ve increased the profile of Black creators in high visibility areas, including front-page placement, on social media, and in our marketing campaigns. Career Growth & Support: Highlighting Black voices and communities is critical, but it can’t happen in isolation. That’s why over the past year we’ve kicked off a number of mentorship programs designed to help Black creators and other underrepresented groups grow on Twitch. This includes specialized workshops focused on hosting and interviewing, creator summits and our esports partnership with Cxmmunity x HBCUs. Tools & Moderation: We’ve recently updated our Hateful Conduct and Harassment Policy to take a stronger stance on hate speech, launched new and improved safety tools including Mod View, and improvements to machine learning models that better detect and block offensive usernames. We’ve also created a dedicated team to help remove inherent biases from our technology. We know there’s still work to be done, and we’re continuing to refine our tools and policies to reduce hate and harassment. Local Community Efforts: We know it’s not just about showing up to be an ally on Twitch – it’s also about showing up IRL in our communities. So this year we’re launching a new program that gives our employees time and resources to partner with organizations benefiting Black communities where we live on a regular and ongoing basis. And for everyone looking to make a difference with your communities, here’s some ways you can get involved: Raid and Collaborate with Black creators - Collaborating with other streamers can grow both your streams and also lift up other creators. If you haven’t already, take time to expand your network to include Black creators. We’ve listed some who will be featured this month, but there are many more doing amazing stuff all across Twitch. Fundraise for Charity - Charity fundraising is a core part of the Twitch community and there are many organizations focused on supporting and uplifting Black people. To get started check out some of these organizations on Tiltify. And for tips on running a successful charity stream, our Creator Camp on Charity Streaming is waiting for you. Talk to Your Community - 2020 has shown that many of you are willing to have tough conversations with your community. If you haven’t already talked with your community about the importance of Black History Month, Black Lives Matter, and supporting Black creators check out these resources: The Ally Track. The importance of black history and why it should be celebrated beyond February. Black History Month 2021 Theme. Racism Defined. 103 Things White People Can Do for Racial Justice. The Difference Between First-Degree Racism and Third-Degree Racism. Yes, You Should Speak Up If Your Family Or Friends Post Something Racist. Supporting Black-Owned Businesses Should Be More Than Just A Trend. Set up Your Channel Rules - Be proactively anti-racist by setting up your channel rules and letting new viewers know you’re building an inclusive community. Report. Don’t Just Ban - Racism, hateful conduct, and harassment have no place on Twitch, social media, or anywhere else. Please report it to us so that we can continue to take action against those who violate our Community Guidelines and seek to harm our community and creators. If you only ban, without reporting, Twitch doesn’t know what happened. Supporting Black creators is something that extends beyond one month of the year, so while we celebrate Black History Month with events we hope you’ll enjoy, we hope everyone continues to recognize Black creators who are creating history every time they go live, all year round. -Twitch.',1384,'Celebrate Black Brilliance on Twitch','

SUBtember is back for its fourth year, and it’s all thanks to your continued support for your favorite streamers. All month long, we’re celebrating both the streamers who pour their passion into Twitch and the viewers who make this community so vibrant. This SUBtember is sponsored by Capital One, and it offers a unique chance for viewers to champion their favorite streamers well beyond September: the more you support, the more you save! When you purchase a new subscription at any tier, you’ll receive: 20% off the first month of new recurring 1-month subscription 25% off the first 3 months of new recurring 3-month subscription 30% off the first 6 months of new recurring 6-month subscription*. This year, SUBtember goes beyond just growing communities.

	('/en/2020/06/30/more-to-love-introducing-new-benefits-for-tier-2-and-tier-3-subscriptions/','Jun 30, 2020. More to Love: Introducing New Benefits for Tier 2 and Tier 3 Subscriptions. Today we’re introducing even more ways to help creators reward their Tier 2 and Tier 3 subscribers with more digital goodies to proudly share their support on Twitch. It all starts with powering up the go-to feature for brand building: emotes. Partners will now have 4 more emote slots per tier for Tier 2 and Tier 3 subscribers by default. That means more opportunities for creators to show off their creativity and more ways to let higher-tier subs further stand out in their community. Get a first look below at the new emotes from /NickEh30, /Sacriel, /TheNo1Alex, /Halocene, /DjTechLive, and swing by the channels of: Chillbo Bagginz, Elix, FireDragon, GameAttackTeam, Klean, lilsimsie, Matthewkheafy, Ninja614, NorthernLion, PVPX, thedragonfeeney, TheHungerService to gander their newest creations up now. Then be on the lookout for the millions more making their way onto Twitch! Secondly, Tier 2 and Tier 3 subscribers can dress those special emotes up with unlimited access of Partner selected modified emote filters. Partners can choose from Grayscale, Horizontal Flip, Pinch, Shades, and Think modifiers, to give new and classic premium emotes a fresh new look. Subscribers will have access to one emote modifier filter for Tier 2, and two filters for Tier 3. Finally, to help Affiliates and Partners shine a light on their higher tier supporters, we’re excited to introduce Badge Flair! Badge Flair lets Tier 2 and Tier 3 subscribers get instantly recognized in chat for their next level support. Badge Flair is a design overlay that decorates the sub badge in chat and is applied automatically when enabled by the creator. By default, Twitch will provide a subscription star flair icon on every Affiliate and Partner channel but creators can also design custom flair that matches their channel brand. Together these new features will help creators reward Tier 2 and Tier 3 subscribers on Twitch with more ways to express themselves with little sustained effort to manage these new benefits over time. That’s what next level love looks like! To get started, creators can log into the Creator Dashboard to add, customize, and select the Tier 2 and Tier sub benefits on their channels.

Movie night just got an upgrade: Introducing Watch Parties. **Update: As of June 16, 2020,**we’ve released the feature to viewers worldwide. Prime Video content availability will vary, based on regional licensing agreements. Prime Video titles that are viewable by most Prime members on Twitch will include a “Broadly Available” badge in the Watch Parties catalog. Update: As of May 7, 2020, Watch Parties are now available for all creators in the United States. We expect to make it available globally in the coming months. We have also rolled out the Watch Parties catalog to let you stream any title available with your Prime Video membership. Last October, we asked a small group of creators to help us test an early version of Watch Parties on Twitch, a new feature that brings creators and their communities together to enjoy a selection of popular movies and TV shows available on Prime Video including Amazon Originals. Since then, we’ve been hard at work gathering feedback and making changes to improve the experience including Picture-by-Picture format, so viewers can see and hear creator reactions in real time, as well as enabling Subs and Bits. During this time of uncertainty, we know how valuable shared experiences like Watch Parties are to our community. This is why we’ve decided to open the beta to all Twitch Partners in the United States with an active Prime membership and will make it available to all creators in the United States who are Amazon Prime members in the coming weeks. We appreciate all the feedback we’ve received so far, and have heard the need to make Watch Parties available to our global community. This is a priority for our team, and we are working closely with our Prime Video counterparts to make Watch Parties available to creators and viewers who are Amazon Prime members worldwide over the coming months. New U.S. and global creators will receive an email notification when Watch Parties has been added to their Creator Dashboard. The current version of Watch Parties includes a selection of movies and TV shows that were requested by the community including Amazon Originals such as Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan, Hunters and Troop Zero as well as community favorites such as Star Trek, Survivor, Psych, and RWBY (volume 4, 5 and 6). We expect to expand and include the entire Prime Video SVOD on-demand catalog this year. Here is a list of titles available to watch today. We want to thank our community for helping us improve the Watch Parties experience. Watch Parties are still a work in progress, and we look forward to your continued feedback.

Update Feb 7, 2020 There’s no better feeling than lighting up chat with gifted subscriptions! Gifting subscriptions in a channel supports the streamer and welcomes new viewers into our favorite communities in a whole new way. Now, viewers on iOS can invite non-subscribed members of the community to experience the magic of ad-free viewing, Sub-only chats, streamer emotes, and Sub badges to stand out in chat. Viewers on iOS can purchase and redeem Sub Tokens on iOS to gift a Tier 1 subscription for one month to specific people in the channel by tapping their name in Chat and then confirming the gift subscription prompts. Viewers can also tap the Gift a Sub button in the channel details section to gift up to 50 subscriptions to the community at a time. Twitch then matches the gifted subscriptions with members of the community and lets them know through a chat callout and with a message in the notification bell that they’ve received a gift. To get started viewers can update the Twitch app from the App store. To learn more about Gift Subscriptions on iOS read the Help Article. Original story: At TwitchCon San Diego we announced a lot of cool new stuff coming to Twitch that will help streamers connect with their communities and help viewers support their favorite streamers. Until now, viewers on iOS weren’t able to subscribe to their favorite channels from the Twitch mobile app. That changes today with the launch of iOS Sub Tokens. Starting NOW, viewers on iOS can subscribe to any Partner or Affiliate channel directly from the Twitch iOS app. Subscriptions on iOS work a little differently than on desktop, so here’s everything you need to know:Viewers can purchase iOS Sub Tokens through the Twitch app. Each token can be redeemed for a one-month Tier 1 subscription. You can extend your subscription by redeeming more tokens [up to 12 at one time] or by purchasing more tokens to redeem later. These Sub Tokens can be redeemed on any Affiliate or Partner channel that offer Tier 1 subscriptions, and they offer the same benefits as if you subscribed on desktop: sub badges, subscriber emotes, ad-free viewing, sub-only chat—all of it. Creators get paid a share of the iOS subscription, just as they do for subscriptions purchased on other platforms. To ensure streamers earn a similar revenue from Subs regardless of platform, tokens cost $5.99 to account for mobile app store fees. To start subbing on iOS, update your Twitch app and click the video screen to make the subscribe button appear. And to celebrate the launch, all through October, you’ll be able to buy 2 Sub Tokens for only $8.99*. For more on iOS Sub Tokens, check out our help page. *This is a limited time offer that ends on October 31, 2019 at 11:59 PM PST. Twitch reserves the right to modify or cancel the offer at any time.

	('/en/2019/06/26/superfans-welcome-subscriber-streams-are-coming-to-twitch-fc90cab23a73/','Jun 26, 2019 - By Matt McCloskey. Superfans welcome: Subscriber Streams are coming to Twitch. Communities are the :bleedPurple: heart of Twitch. When streamers and their viewers come together week after week to bond over the things they love, they build authentic connections that make Twitch a place like none other. Creators often ask us for new and better ways to reward their viewers; VIP badges and custom Sub emotes are just a few examples. The next gadget we’re adding to their kit is Subscriber Streams. This feature launches in beta today, and we’re breaking it down right here, right now. What are Subscriber Streams and how do they work? Subscriber Streams are an exciting new way for streamers to offer another benefit to some of their biggest supporters — subscribers, VIPs, and Mods. If a viewer subscribes to a channel at any tier, including a Twitch Prime subscription, they’ll have access to that creator’s Subscriber Streams. If they’re not a subscriber and they arrive on a channel that’s running a Subscriber Stream, they’ll see a preview of what’s going on and, if they’d like, they’ll be able to join the party immediately by subscribing. What are the requirements? We’re excited to get this feature into as many creators’ hands as possible, but it’s also crucial that streamers and their communities stay safe and follow our guidelines (see the section below). The requirements to broadcast a Subscriber Stream are: The streamer must be a Twitch Affiliate or Twitch Partner. The streamer must have broadcasted at least 90 unique days as Affiliate or Partner. The streamer must not have violated the Twitch Community Guidelines in their last 90 unique broadcast days. This means that if their channel received a suspension, they would need to broadcast on 90 different days without another violation to be eligible again. Steps we’re taking to help keep Subscriber Streams safe. As with any other stream on Twitch, Subscriber Stream content must fall under our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines. Subscriber Streams are not private, and we’ve taken steps to ensure a safe and welcoming experience: As mentioned above, to broadcast a Subscriber Stream, creators must have streamed 90 unique days without a violation. If a qualified streamer does receive a violation, they’ll need to meet this requirement all over again to re-earn access to the feature — starting from day 0. Subscriber Streams are not private streams. When you arrive at a Subscriber Stream as a non-subscriber, you’ll be able to preview the content live, subscribe, and join the community right away if you’d like. Subscriber Streams are tagged “Subscriber Stream” for easy discoverability. This tag cannot be removed, and it will always appear first when multiple tags are in use. People can view live previews and report content if they believe it violates our Terms of Service or Community Guidelines. Subscriber Streams are launching in beta. If you have ideas about how to improve Subscriber Streams, we’d love to get your feedback right here. What kind of stuff can creators do with Subscriber Streams? Streamers on Twitch have a way of surprising all of us by using our new features in unexpected ways (we’re looking at you, Squad Streamers), but we could definitely see competitive streamers taking requests on heroes or champions to play, tabletop streamers running a weekly campaign for Subs, music streamers making all-request set lists, and a whole lot more. What does a Subscriber Stream look like? Pretty much the same as any other stream — but there are a few small differences. Subscriber Streams will automatically be tagged “Subscriber Stream” for easy discoverability, and the tag cannot be removed. Subscriber Streams will also feature a star icon (like the one on the Subscribe button) in the left nav on twitch.tv. And lastly, arriving at a channel running a Subscriber Stream as a non-subscriber will bring up a live content preview. If you like what that community is into, you can subscribe to join immediately and start watching and chatting to your (purple) heart’s content. In short, they look like this. How do VODs work for Subscriber Streams? After a Subscriber Stream, the corresponding VOD will automatically be available for Subscribers. This is regardless of whether the Subscriber-only archives setting in your Dashboard settings is toggled on or off. If you so choose, you can edit permissions on individual Subscriber Stream VODs via the Video Producer tab of your dashboard. How do Clips work for Subscriber Streams? Clips can still be created during a Subscriber Stream and shared during and after the stream. Clips created from Subscriber Streams will not have any restrictions placed on them. If you do not wish for Clips to be shared you may moderate your Clips accordingly in the Clips Manager. Will Subscriber Streams stop me from completing my Affiliate “Path to Partner” Achievement? No, we understand that by broadcasting Subscriber Streams your overall CCU may be lower. As such, we do not wish to penalize Affiliates that wish to create custom content for their loyal subscribers. Subscriber Streams are available now to Partners and Affiliates who meet the requirements above. Check it out on your dashboard, or visit the help page for more information.',869,'Superfans welcome: Subscriber Streams are coming to Twitch','

Charity Extensions: making the world a better place one stream at a time. Help cure cancer, end hunger, and raise awareness with Charity in Extensions. Twitch is proud to recognize three very special Extensions supporting charitable causes on your favorite broadcasters’ streams throughout 2019. Tiltify Donations, DonorDrive’s AFSP Charity Fundraising, and Gamers Beat Cancer by GameChanger unlock the power of Twitch community to drive more donations to charity through engaging and interactive experiences in Extensions. Make the world a better place just by streaming and using Extensions in support of charity. Tiltify Donations. Take Tiltify, our flagship charity partner for Twitch Extensions. Leveraging Amazon Pay, they built the first version of a panel Extension that lets broadcasters set up a drive for a cause and track donation progress over time. A new version of Tiltify Donations adds broadcaster rewards, challenges, and polls to drive more awareness and support from broadcasters’ audiences during a fundraising event. Tiltify is currently raising funds for St Jude Play Live, a prize month fundraiser, through May 31. Additionally, May 18 is Tiltify’s official Red Nose Day’s Nose Bowl where Broadcasters and celebrities will join forces between 12PM PST and 5PM PST to raise funds to end child poverty. “Tiltify was created specifically to help streamers maximize their charity fundraising. We have proudly been used by the streaming community since 2014 and work with over 600 charities in seven countries. We’re available for any of your favorite charities with no sign up fee.” — Tiltify CEO Michael Wasserman. DonorDrive. DonorDrive joins us supporting the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and Children’s Miracle Network via the Extra Life Charity Leaderboard. Featuring mobile donation support on iOS and Android, both of these Extensions showcase which broadcasters raised the most during a drive for their charity. “The Extension essentially activates an Extra Life-themed channel badge that’s connected to the content creator’s fundraising page. [It] allows viewers to donate directly to their local children’s hospital without ever having to leave Twitch. This Twitch Extension is literally saving kids’ lives by connecting Twitch’s passionate community with seamless donation technology!” — Mike Kinney, Managing Director of Digital Fundraising and Children’s Miracle Network. DonorDrive plans to launch support for more charities throughout 2019. GameChanger. Last but never least is GameChanger. Their most recent drive for American Cancer Society raised tens of thousands of dollars and plenty of awareness for the organization’s sweeping efforts across the United States to raise funds to end cancer. The developer has big plans for more events in 2019, and you can get behind them with just one click in the GameChanger Charity Extension.

	('/en/2019/04/02/creating-monetization-opportunities-for-developers-and-streamers-771d13060f19/','Apr 2, 2019 - By Arcadio Lainez. Creating Monetization Opportunities for Developers and Streamers. Expanding on our goal to help streamers and developers generate revenue on Twitch, today we’re announcing new features that will enable developers to build new monetized Extension experiences. The first two features — Subscription Status in Extensions and Subscription Purchase Trigger — will help developers unlock new ways for streamers to reward viewers who purchase a monthly subscription to their channel. Bits Enablement will let developers reach more streamer channels with the same Extension without needing to build multiple versions. Bits Transaction History enables developers to keep track of Extensions transactions. Let’s dive in. Subscription Status. Sub Status allows an Extension to request permission from the streamer to obtain read access to a channel’s subscriber list. Subscriptions are one of the best ways for streamers to generate revenue on Twitch. When a viewer subscribes to a streamer’s channel, they are supporting the streamer with a tiered subscription that is automatically renewed monthly. This is how many streamers, like Ninja and Shroud, generate part of their revenue. Streamers reward viewers who subscribe with perks such as exclusive emotes, sub badges, subscribers-only Chat, ads-free viewing and more. Extensions are active on more than 67 percent of Affiliate- and Partner-level channels and viewers have interacted with Extensions more than 1.8 billion times in 2019 so far. By sharing the viewers sub status in the Extension itself, we see an opportunity for incremental subscriptions growth. Sharing the subs status in a highly visible extension will improve a viewer’s ability to see their current subscription status and motivate them to either purchase or renew. Beyond the standard subs benefits, Subs-enabled Extensions can now help streamers offer truly differentiated experiences and benefits at each subscription tier. By adding a viewer’s sub status in the Extension, we are also unlocking a developer’s creativity to create subs benefits that are unique to the streamer’s channel. The ability to differentiate a viewer’s subs benefits is a tool that streamers see as necessary to grow and retain their subscriptions base. Providing viewers unique opportunities to actively participate in a channel is a proven engagement strategy increases engagement and monetization opportunities for streamers immediately and for developers in the near future. Subs Status is available now and can be implemented on any released Extension. Developers can implement this feature through the new dedicated Monetization tab in their Extensions dashboard. Streamers can enable and revoke Subs Status by toggling the Manage Permissions flag in their dashboard, which will pass the proper OAuth permission to developers. Subscription Purchase Trigger. To kick off the subscription purchase flow from an Extension, we have also released the Subscription Purchase Trigger in limited preview. Subs Status and Purchase Trigger work together to drive awareness of unique sub benefits and the ability to pay or upgrade a viewer’s subscription level. Bits Enablement. To help developers better manage their Extension’s monetization states, we’re announcing Bits Enablement. While we have seen numerous developers launch and have success with Bits-enabled Extensions, it has not been possible for developers to refactor their existing non-monetized Extensions with Bits options. In order for developers to release Bits-monetized Extensions, they currently have to build and maintain a second version of their Extension, which has proven difficult for streamers to adopt. Similarly, many streamers have not been able to install some Extensions on their channel because only Bits-enabled versions are offered. Extensions can now be used on all channels. With Bits Enablement, Twitch is making it easier for developers to monetize their Extensions with Bits at any stage of the Extension’s life cycle. Developers can revise their released non-monetized Extensions with Bits-enabled features by going to the Monetization tab in the console. This means that developers can now reach more streamers without having to support two different code and user bases. Similarly, streamers will be able to capture new monetization opportunities as more Extensions add Bits features. Bits Transaction History. To help developers keep track of Extension transactions, we are announcing Bits Transaction History in Beta. This new feature will let developers focus on creating great Extensions experiences without having to worry about building foundational infrastructure to support it. Developers will be able to retrieve the entire transaction history of Bits used in their Extension. Developers can review transactions by user, channel, Extension and product. Bits Enablement in Action. We are also excited to announce that the following partners have revamped their existing Extensions using these new Bits enablement features: Live Emotes. Let your viewers push emotes on top of your stream with the new Live Emotes 2019! Viewers can now charge emotes with special power ups and use Bits to fire them away! Sound Alerts. As a monetized Extension, viewers can play sounds on a stream and establish a new viewer interaction and community engagement. Now available for activation in non-monetized channels. Latest Followers. Now allows followers to celebrate their allegiance with Bits by highlighting how long they have been following a streamer. Twitch Picks. Now streamers can customize their polls and allow viewers to vote with Bits. Getting started. Help us define the future of Subs-enabled Extensions by building unique use cases that create temporary, but noticeable actions in the channel. When we build experiences that facilitate streamer and viewer interaction, we create value for all of Twitch. Developers can start building Extensions with Subscriptions-enabled functionality and revamping their existing Extensions with monetized and non-monetized states now by visiting the Developer Console. Visit the documentation to learn more. Let us know what you think by connecting with us on Discord | Twitter | Developer Forum. Have an idea you’d like to explore for Subs and Bits-enabled Extensions? Connect with our Developer Partnerships team by email to get started. Ready to build interactive experiences on Twitch?

	('/en/2019/01/22/analyzing-twitch-chat-during-a-pokémon-marathon/','Jan 22, 2019 - By Thomas Debeauvais. Analyzing Twitch chat during a Pokémon Marathon. We dove into Twitch chat during the Pokémon Marathon, and found key moments when viewers sing, cry, and laugh together. Sometimes, weirdly, all three happen at the same time. Context and dataset. Twitch ran a marathon of all Pokémon episodes and movies. The first 13 episodes aired on August 27, from 10am to 4pm PST. While watching Pokémon, we noticed a lot of meming and spamming in chat, even by Twitch standards. So we decided to dive into it. Our dataset has two tables. One consists of all 269k messages posted by viewers during these 6 hours. The messages are lowercased for convenience. The second table consists of emotes usage, it’s also indexed on message id, and has one row per emote use. Twitch chat likes emotes: 61% of chat messages have at least one. Twitch chat also likes to spam emotes: a total of 359k emotes were used, i.e. chatters use on average 2 per message with an emote. Gotta Catch ’Em All. Each of the 13 episodes opens and concludes with the Pokémon theme song, “Pokémon, gotta catch ’em all”. It is a catchy song written in common meter with classic anime lyrics. Its most frequent non-stopword token is “pokemon”, appearing in 14 out of the 45 lines of the theme song. Throughout all 13 episodes, viewers sing along in chat to the theme song, during both the intro and outro. While the average 10-second window during the marathon sees 1.5% of chat messages with the token “pokemon”, this can reach up to 18% during the theme song. The graph below shows a heartbeat-like pattern in the proportion of chat messages with the “pokemon” token. Since each episode is 22 minutes, and intermissions between episodes 4 minutes, this proportion spikes twice every 26 minutes. Text memes: “never seen again” and “pity badge” Throughout his adventures, protagonist Ash encounters various characters whom he leaves but promises to see again. Twitch chat, in disbelief, spams “never seen again”. This goodbye meme started modestly in episode 4, peaked at episode 8 at 17% of chat messages in a 10s window, and dwindled in the following episodes played that day. However, another raw-text meme stayed strong after episode 7. When Ash challenges the three Cerulean Gym leaders, they tell him their Pokémon are exhausted and forfeit their Cascade badge to him without a fight. This prompted chat to spam “pity badge”. This meme peaked at 25% of chat messages during episode 13, when Ash showed his badges proudly. Viewers love these text memes. LDA topics. We’d like to explore trends involving both emotes and raw text throughout the day. Moreover, in Pokémon, the scenario moves quickly: one minute is slapstick running-around, with chat laughing, and the next tearful melodrama, with chat crying. LDA seems appropriate. We first remove stop words (“the”, “is”, “are”, etc.), then treat each minute of chat as a document for LDA. LDA then treats each minute of chat as a mixture of topics, and outputs the top words for these topics. A topic is an assignment of a weight to each word, for example {‘pokemon’:0.9, ‘sourpls’:0.8, …}. All words appear in all topics, but the topic’s top words enable us humans to interpret it. We played around with the number of topics, and ended at 11, a local minimum. The resulting topics are displayed below. Let’s deep dive into 2 of these topics: the sad topic, and the Team Rocket topic. The sad topic. Topic 9 is about the sad moments in Pokémon. It loads heavily on tokens like “biblethump”, which is a tearful Twitch emote expressing commiseration, sometimes used sarcastically. It also loads heavily on words related to the Pokémon Charmander. We believe that words related to Charmander are prominent in topic 9 because of episode 11, in which Ash meets Charmander, and a very sad and melodramatic story unfolds. Chat was ready to react. Here’s a close-up of episode 11’s BibleThump-ness. While the episode is very melodramatic in the beginning, it quickly turns around, and chat spams PogChamp, an emote indicating amazement. These flip-flopping emotions remind us of the 6 shapes of story arcs. In our case, Twitch chat lets us analyze these story arcs via the audience’s reactions. The Team Rocket topic. The top words in Topic 10 come from the Team Rocket motto!! Prepare for Trouble Make it double To protect the world from devastation To unite all people within our nation To denounce the evils of truth and love To extend our reach to the stars above Jessie James Team Rocket Blast off at the speed of light Surrender now or prepare to fight Meowth, that’s Right! Starting with the Team Rocket’s first appearance in episode 2, and every time they appear thereafter, chat just spams the villains’ motto. Wrapping up. This article dove into chat during the first day of the Pokémon marathon on Twitch. Pokémon brought viewers together in chat, via memes involving raw text, emotes, or both. LDA helped us discover that the most intense memes stem from silly plot elements, melodramatic moments, and catchy theme songs and mottos. This article was co-written by Thomas Debeauvais, Sanjay Kairam, and Brendan Rocks.',875,'Analyzing Twitch chat during a Pokémon Marathon','

Today we celebrated the streamers and fans that make Twitch unique at Day One of our fourth TwitchCon. We kicked off the morning in San Jose recapping the incredible accomplishments we were all a part of this year and shared our battle plan for how we’re playing support for streamers with new tools designed to help them grow, connect, and thrive. We also announced the expansion of our esports program, Twitch Rivals, that will more than double in size in 2019 and introduced Twitch Sings, a new category of game built by Twitch with streaming in mind, that will enter closed beta this year. More people are joining Twitch every day, and once they’re here, they experience what this community has known all along — that together you’ve created something new: Multiplayer Entertainment. You’re not just here for the show; you are the show. At Twitch, streamers aren’t a sidequest. Making sure creators and their communities are succeeding more than ever is our main goal. Here’s a summary of what we announced today, and you can catch the VOD of the live stream here. Grow. Whatever you stream, we’re making it easier for creators to get discovered. Squad Stream: Up to four creators will be able to stream together in a single view that viewers discover when they visit any one of their channels. Viewers can watch on desktop and mobile as well as easily follow and subscribe to all channels. Chat is linked to whichever channel a viewer selects as their main view, so they can hang out with their friends or jump over to another community with just a click or a tap. Select streamers will be testing out Squad Stream later this year. Highlight Editor updates: Highlight Editor will now allow streamers and editors to stitch together moments from across a video into a single highlight. Look for this update in January. New featured sections on the Twitch homepage: Starting later this year we’re rolling out a range of new featured sections like ones highlighting up-and-coming streamers, new Partners and Affiliates, or streamers local to the viewer. Connect. We’re giving streamers more tools to build stronger communities and relationships with their viewers. Strong communities spread the word about their favorite streamers, support each other in times of need, and welcome new viewers into the fold. Those relationships are part of what makes Twitch so different. VIP Badges: Streamers will now be able to recognize valuable members of their community without requiring them to subscribe or moderate with VIP Badges. VIP members are recognized with a badge and can also chat in slow, sub-only, or follower-only modes. Creators earn 10 badges when they complete the “Build a Community” achievement by reaching 50 followers and 5 unique chatters in a stream and can earn up to 100 badges as their community grows. Look for this in a few weeks. (Update: VIP Badges are live as of Nov. 13). New moderator tools in chat: By clicking on someone’s username, mods will be able to see how long that person has been on Twitch and details on their activity in the channel, like chats, number of timeouts, or bans. The update also includes a new comment tool that lets mods work together by leaving notes for each other. These new tools arrive in January. Roles management page: Streamers will able to see and change their community members’ roles– from editors, to mods, to VIP from the new roles section on their dashboard. This is coming alongside VIP Badges in a few weeks. (Update: The Roles page is live as of Nov. 13). Subscription badges now show total number of months: We heard your feedback loud and clear that subscription badges need to reward consistent supporters, even if they miss a sub one month. Sub badges will now change to show the total number of months a viewer has been subscribed. If a viewer is on an amazing streak, they can still choose to share it when they re-subscribe. This update is coming in January. Extensions: As Extensions continue to grow on Twitch, we’re bringing you more ways to interact by teaming up with brands like Adobe, Tiltify, Spotify, as well as our friends at Amazon. Today at TwitchCon, we showed off Snap Camera, Snap’s brand new standalone desktop app that works with a custom Extension built just for Twitch. Snap Camera lets you use Snapchat’s best Lenses live on your stream with your webcam. With the Snap Camera Extension, viewers can use Snapchat to scan the Snapcode on screen to try on the Lens and streamers can reward subs by activating a custom Lens of the streamer’s choosing when someone subscribes. We also created custom Lenses for the Twitch community: like a purple, Super Saiyan power-up, for when you take chat’s energy; or a rain of bits to celebrate Cheers. Snap Camera is available now, you can learn more here. To learn more about all the new Extensions that launched at TwitchCon and Developer Day visit the Developer Blog. Thrive. To make it easier for streamers to find sponsored opportunities that feel authentic and align with their communities’ interests we’re opening Bounty Board to 30 more brands starting in November. Partners and select affiliates in the U.S. and Canada will be able to use Bounty Board to earn even more, and coming in 2019 and we’ll open it to more affiliates and more countries beginning with the UK. Twitch Sings. We’re just starting to scratch the surface of what’s possible when everyone wants to play together. There are many games and genres that are made better on Twitch, and we believe there’s an opportunity for a new category of game to emerge that’s made to be streamed, where the audience isn’t a ‘nice to have’ — they’re a crucial part of the game experience. We knew karaoke would be the perfect place to start. It’s live. It’s always entertaining. And when it really gets going, the line between the crowd and the stage disappears completely. With Twitch Sings, you can sing your heart out, share your performances across Twitch, or perform duets with your community. And being in the crowd is just as much fun as holding the mic — and just as important. In chat you can request songs, give your favorite streamers crazy challenges to tackle, and when you cheer you will see Bits will rain down on the crowd. We’re testing Twitch Sings on the expo floor at TwitchCon and soon with a handful of streamers live on Twitch in closed beta. We can’t wait to hear what you think and you can go here and register if you’re interested in trying it out. More of you will be invited as space opens up.',1137,'TwitchCon 2018 Keynote: Everything You Need to Know','

Partners and Affiliates do so much to build amazing communities on Twitch, and a huge part of growing those audiences is getting subscribers who consistently watch, chat, spam emotes, make Clips, and more. With Gifted Subs and Community Gifting, we gave viewers the power to help out their favorite streamers by inviting new friends to the party. This SUBtember, we’re making it easier than ever to keep the Sub train going with a great month-long deal: continue a gifted subscription for 80% off! This deal applies to Tier 1 subscriptions, meaning you can turn any Tier of your gifted Sub into a recurring Tier 1 Sub for just $1 (final price may vary by region, see FAQ below). And yes, streamers will still get the full amount from the Sub. To take advantage of this 80% off promotion, you need to have an active gifted subscription during 9/10–9/30 and commit to a paid subscription during this time. If you’ve already set up your gift subscription to renew between 9/10 and 9/30, you can still take advantage of SUBTember pricing. To obtain the promotional price, you’ll need to cancel the Sub continuation at your subscriptions management page and then choose to continue the gift sub again between 9/10 and 9/30 . Ready to support your favorite streams and keep access to all those custom badges and emotes? Below are the two ways to continue your subscription, and please note that this promotion is only available if you sign-up on a desktop web browser. Visit the Streamer’s channel and click “Continue” on the top of the video player. Visit your subscriptions management page and click on the “Gift Subscriptions” tab. Then find the streamer’s panel and click “Continue.” Got more questions? We’ve got answers. Q: I had a gift sub that was set to expire before 9/10 and I renewed it at the regular Tier 1 price. Can I retroactively get the promotional price? No, your subscription renewal must fall between 9/10 and 9/30 in order to get the promotional price. Q: If my gift sub expired before 9/10, can I get the promotional price? No, your subscription renewal must fall between 9/10 and 9/30 in order to get the promotional price. Q: What exactly do I need to do to take advantage of this promotion? Visit either the Streamer’s channel, or your Subscriptions Management Page. Click “Continue”, select a Tier 1 sub at the discounted price and complete your checkout. Q: What is the discount if I continue my gifted sub as a Tier 1? Tier 1 is discounted at a whopping 80% off, which is just $1 before taxes and fees. Your final price may vary based on region. Q: Is there a limit to how many times I can do this? As long as you have an active gift sub to a channel, you can take advantage of this! The discounted price only applies to the first month of the Tier 1 paid sub. After the first month, it will return to the normal price. Q: What channels does this apply to? Any Partner and Affiliate channel as long as they offer a recurring subscription. Q: Does this apply to all Tiers of subscription? The discount only applies to Tier 1 paid subscriptions. If you currently have a gifted subscription at Tier 2 or 3, you can continue to a paid subscription at the same Tier for the regular price or continue at Tier 1 for the discounted price. Q: How long will the paid subscription be discounted for? Only the first month of the gift-to-paid subscription will be discounted. After one month, the subscription will return to normal price. Q: When am I charged for the paid subscription? Your paid subscription will start when your gifted subscription ends. Q: What about tax and VAT? The discount is on the base price of the subscription before any taxes/VAT are applied. Q: When exactly is this happening? Starting 12:00PM PDT September 10th and ending 11:59PM PDT September 30th. Q: Does this work on the Android or iOS Twitch Apps? No, to take advantage of this discounted price you’ll have to visit twitch.tv/subscriptions or the streamer’s channel in a desktop web browser. Q: If I receive a gift sub to a channel I’ve never subbed to before, and after the gifted month I decide to continue the sub, does my tenure start at month one or month two? Your tenure would continue as month two, because gifted subs count toward sub tenure. Don’t forget to share your resub notification in the channel. Q: I want to buy a multi-month bundle (i.e. 3 months or 6 months). Do these qualify for the promotion? The 3 and 6 month Subscription bundles do not qualify for this promotion. Q: I committed to continue my subscription already, will I also get the promotional price? If you previously committed to renew your subscription between 9/10 and 9/30 you will need to cancel your continuation at your subscriptions management page and continue the gift sub again to obtain the promotional price. For more details, please check the email associated with your Twitch account. Q: My gift sub continuation will hit in October, will I still get the promotional price? You must commit to renew between 9/10 and 9/30 to qualify for the promotion price.

Q: My gift sub expires on 9/15, can I renew it the rest of the month at the promotional price? In order to take advantage of the SUBtember promotion, you have to continue your sub while it’s still active.

	('/en/2018/09/06/behind-the-development-the-pokemon-badge-collector-extension-af8ce9438187/','Sep 6, 2018 - By Ryan Lee. Behind the Development: The Pokémon Badge Collector Extension. Few entertainment franchises have achieved global success in the same way Pokémon has. Last week, Twitch and The Pokémon Company International kicked off Pokémon: The Series extravaganza featuring 16 movies and 900+ episodes to be live-streamed in several different marathons spanning into 2019. This will be the single longest programmatic viewing event to stream on Twitch. __Another aspect we’re particularly excited about is the Pokémon Badge Collector Extension. This super-slick and engaging, interactive overlay allows viewers to virtually collect Pokémon badges while they watch. To activate the Extension, viewers click on the Poké Ball overlay and start collecting Pokémon badges. That’s not all, though; the Extension is feature packed including: Achievements — track lifetime stats, such as points and total badges collected over the course of the entire marathon. Inventory — review and search through all the Pokémon you’ve caught. Leaderboard — see how you rank with friends and other Pokémon fans who are also watching and playing along. Bonuses — complete individual and global community goals to earn special bonuses and rewards. We caught up with the creative folks over at Stink Studios to learn more about what went into building such a unique and innovative Extension for Twitch. TwitchDev: Why are you excited about this program and Extension? Stink Studios: Twitch is the only major live streaming platform that offers a way for developers to create interactive applications that exist over the content. Plus, anyone can build an Extension and distribute it to broadcasters, truly democratizing this platform’s feature. Here at Stink Studios, we’ve contextualized this as a sort-of augmented reality: an Extension acts as that heads-up display to live content. There is a lot of talk about the merging of technology and content; Twitch Extensions do this. TwitchDev: Is this the first Extension you’ve built for Twitch? If yes, where did you start? Stink Studios: This is our first Extension that we’ve built for Twitch. When building for a new platform, the very first place we start is the documentation. Fortunately, Twitch Extensions has written pretty thorough information to get developers started, but leaves it pretty open-ended so developers can customize their codebase to suit their needs. The next step we did was to do a general audit of the landscape, combing through pre-existing Extensions and searching Github for publicly available codebases. Finally, we prototyped typical network relation strategies — 1:1, 1:N, N:N, and N:1 — within the Twitch Developer Rig since these patterns would be the foundation to our extension. TwitchDev: Can you briefly describe your development process, including how you came up with the idea, how long it took, what you did to test or troubleshoot, etc.? Stink Studios: Here at Stink Studios, creative and technical teams work closely together to come up with new concepts for clients. We iterated a lot of ideas together in what we call a “grab-bag deck.” One idea that stuck out was collecting badges throughout a stream’s duration. In particular, how can we reward viewers for active watching? Twitch told us that they think Pokémon would be a great content partner for this concept, and we did another round where we tied the technical concept with the content. From there, we created UX documentation about how the Extension works, such as user flows and game mechanics, which flowed into creative designs that gave the Extension a look and feel that is consistent with both the Twitch and Pokémon universes. These first two phases (UX and design with technical R&D) took about four weeks. Finally, we went into our coding process, where we began to actually build the Extension from the ground up. Since this was a new platform for us, we had to vet out how the Extension works across different screen sizes, as well as how to handle about 100,000 concurrent users within this context. Then, we created an overall backend systems architecture and split out the visual components to be built out on the front end. We divided and conquered over about six quick sprints, which took us about five weeks to build. However, now that we have a lot of the infrastructure encapsulated as reusable components, we can have the foundation to build any future extensions efficiently. TwitchDev: Describe the tech behind this Extension? Any hurdles you had to overcome? Stink Studios: For the front end of this project, we used React and Redux since they are battle-tested and production-ready libraries that have a lot of community support. We sometimes use Vue on other projects, but since the Twitch Developer Rig is already built with React for the front end, so we decided to align with that. For the back end of this project, we used a serverless architecture, built on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Serverless architecture is a relatively new backend paradigm, where the server only exists when data is transmitted to it, rather than having a box that is “always-on.” In particular, we used AWS API Gateway and Lambda to both handle our users and their badge collections, which are stored on an Aurora database. In order to alleviate stress on the database when a lot of users collected a badge simultaneously, we needed a way to slow down all the requests. To accommodate this, we used AWS’s SQS as a virtual conveyor belt. Interestingly enough, SQS is actually one of the oldest services on AWS. In combination with all of the relatively new services we have used, it served as a good contrast in our architecture. Finally, to be incredibly reactive to viewers, we leaned into optimistic updates with eventual consistency model. That is to say, viewers would immediately see their badge and stat updates after a collection without having to wait for the server to return any information. Once the server processed all the information in bulk, it would validate their collection and tell the front end, which would either retain the collection or rollback the change. Using these principles allows for viewers to have immediate gratification without sacrificing the verification of their actions. TwitchDev: The Extension initially had some outages due to significantly higher usage than expected, can you describe how you optimized and scaled to keep up with demand? Stink Studios: This outage affected primarily our Users API. In particular, viewers entering the stream were not able to access the Extension. If you were in the stream before the outage occurred, you could actually keep collecting Pokémon badges. Our primary issue was bottlenecks with the database. We made a lot of optimizations to our AWS Lambda functions to pool and reuse database connections, but ultimately, pivoted away from using a serverless architecture to a more typical server-based setup on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Fortunately, we were using a framework that made the transition relatively painless. Although our Collect API is still a serverless microservice, it makes more sense for our Users API to use a more typical pattern for accessing and writing user information. Most of the time, the tried-and-true solutions work the best!

When we launched Twitch Prime, we were determined to give streamers and their viewers the best value in gaming. And since then we’ve seen the Twitch community take advantage of Twitch Prime perks like monthly channel subscriptions to support favorite streamers, Free Games with Prime, and in-game loot for games like Fortnite, PUBG, Hearthstone, and more. On top of everything you get through Amazon Prime, this year alone we’ve offered members more than $1,000 worth of games and loot. As we have continued to add value to Twitch Prime, we have also re-evaluated some of the existing Twitch Prime benefits. As a result, universal ad-free viewing will no longer be part of Twitch Prime for new members, starting on September 14. Twitch Prime members with monthly subscriptions will continue to get ad-free viewing until October 15. If you already have an annual subscription, or if you upgrade to an annual subscription before September 14, you will continue with ad-free viewing until your next renewal date. All other Twitch Prime benefits, like monthly channel subs, monthly games and loot, and chat badges are not changing. But…why? Advertising is an important source of support for the creators who make Twitch possible. This change will strengthen and expand that advertising opportunity for creators so they can get more support from their viewers for doing what they love. We want Twitch to remain a place where anyone can enjoy one-of-a-kind interactive entertainment, and ads allow us to continue making Twitch the best place for creators to build communities around the things they love and make money doing it. Is ad-free viewing still possible on Twitch? An ad-free viewing experience is still possible! All Twitch viewers can get ad-free viewing across all channels by subscribing to Twitch Turbo (read about Turbo right here). Additionally, Twitch Prime subscribers can still get channel-specific ad-free viewing as part of Prime by using your monthly subscription token on a channel that has ad-free viewing for subscribers turned on. More of what matters. Twitch Prime is still, and will always be, packed with premium benefits you can’t get anywhere else. We’re just getting started, and the community can continue to expect more and better free games with Prime and in-game loot every month, monthly channel subscriptions, exclusive badges, along with new benefits and surprises. And with your Twitch Prime membership you can still take advantage of all the other Amazon Prime benefits, like free two-day shipping and access to Prime Video and Prime Music¹. Thanks to every Twitch Prime member for supporting Twitch and your favorite streamers. We’ll see you in chat. ¹ Amazon Prime benefits vary by marketplace.',446,'Changes to Twitch Prime','

What if we told you you could bring your very own panel to life this year at TwitchCon? You’d probably just believe us because we ask you every single year, but still… it’s pretty cool! Starting today, we’re accepting your proposals right here for awesome stuff to do at TwitchCon. Sure, we’re cooking up plenty of our own ideas too, but this is your show, and it just wouldn’t be complete without some ideas that came straight from the community. If your ideas are a bit more hands-on, that’s great too! Artist Alley will be open for business once again, so apply to feature your work and sell awesome art directly to the community. We’re also hosting our annual Cosplay Contest with a giant prizepool over $70,000, and speedrunning is joining the party in San Jose with GDQ Express. If you’ve got the skills for any or all of these of these, we want to hear about it. Especially if you can somehow do all three at once. For panel submissions, our esteemed TwitchCon committee will review every one and select the best of the best. If yours is selected, you’ll be notified by no later than August 3, plus you and all participants will be given TwitchCon speaker badges on the house. Additionally, if the TwitchCon team thinks there’d be a good match, they may put a featured speaker or two on your panel. You’d be notified of this by August 3 as well, so don’t worry about Ninja showing up on your panel unannounced or anything like that. One last thing: we strongly encourage waiting to purchase a TwitchCon ticket until you know whether you’re speaking/arting/competing or not. We aren’t offering refunds on badges, so holding off until the August 3 notification date is the best way to go. Don’t worry. We’ll save a seat for you.

Support streamers (and get gifts) by Cheering for your favorite World Cup team. Update 6/29/18: We’ve heard your Cheers loud and clear! We’ve received so much positive feedback for this event that we’ve added two more sets of emotes! Our streamers have been positively overwhelmed by your support. To thank our Cheerers, after you have unlocked the original permanent emote, you can unlock the new sets by Cheering 150 Bits or more. So if you continue to support your streamer by Cheering them on, you will unlock these and gift some people in chat one of the emotes as well! Don’t worry these sets are entirely optional and we haven’t added these sets to the requirement for unlocking the permanent emote. The World Cup is the world’s biggest sports event, and we have no doubt many of you will be tuning in to cheer on your nation’s team in The Beautiful Game (soccer in the US, football everywhere else). While cheering for your favorite team, why not also Cheer to support your favorite streamers? Cheering already has plenty of benefits on Twitch, like celebrating special moments with streamers, amplifying your voice in chat, and earning Bit badges, but from now through July 15, Cheering will do even more. Let’s break down the X’s and O’s. If you Cheer 1 to 149 Bits, you’ll receive a gift containing one of the three temporary football related emote sets below. When you Cheer 150 Bits or more, you’ll receive one of the emote sets and share one of those emotes with other viewers in chat as a special gift. We also have a brand new football Cheermote that’s bound to come in handy during one of the many goals that will hit the back of the nets in the weeks to come. Once you receive one or more football emotes, you’ll find them right in the emote selector. And when you collect all three sets of temporary football emotes you’ll get a permanent one so you can show off that you supported your streamer and your team long after the tournament is over. If you need to fill your pockets with Bits, load up here. Questions? We’ve got answers. Q: When exactly is this happening? Starting now and ending 10AM PT on July 16. Q: Do streamers still receive the same revenue share from Twitch for the Cheer/Bits? Yes. Cheering Bits is a great way to support your streamer and this event’s Cheermote is no different from regular or channel specific Cheermotes! Q: How long can I use the temporary Football emotes? Until August 15, 2018. Q: What exactly is in the Football Gifts? Each gift contains one of three sets of football themed emotes. If you Cheer three times you get access to all three. Q: Are the emotes I receive randomly selected? Yes, but the randomness is only for the order you receive the sets. After Cheering three times you’re guaranteed to have access to all the football themed emotes. There is no chance of getting a duplicate gift! Q: How are the Football emotes awarded? Cheer between 1–149 Bits and you will receive one of the three sets of Football Themed Emotes. If you Cheer 150 Bits or more you’ll also activate a gift for a number of other viewers in chat who will receive an emote from the set you just received. Q: Can I Cheer 100 Bits now and 50 Bits later and still gift the emote for my fellow chatters? No, you have to Cheer with at least 150 Bits in one single Cheer to gift the football emote to your chat buddies. Q: Does this mean Twitch is streaming the World Cup? No, and in fact that makes this the first event of this scale that we won’t stream any direct content for. At Twitch we believe it’s important to try new things, and since the Football World Cup is the biggest event in sports, this is a great moment for an experiment! Q: If I have received all the Football Emotes and then Cheer again later on, will I receive duplicate emotes? You only receive the Football Emotes once. You won’t receive another Gift for Cheering after you have collected them all but it will still support the streamer and contribute towards Bit Badges as normal. Q: Are all channels taking part in this Cheering event? Only select channels. Q: Can I turn this off for my channel? Partners and Affiliates, you can turn off the features of this event by visiting your dashboard settings. Q: Are the features of this event live for all channels? Channels have the option to opt out of the event and it’s not available on the Overwatch League and Heroes of the Storm Global Championship channels. An easy way to see if you can earn the emotes is by checking if the Footy the Football Cheermote is available on the channel. Q: Where do I find my emotes? Once you receive one or more Football emotes, you’ll find them in the emote selector. Q: Where do I get more Bits? Bits.twitch.tv. Q: What are Bits and Cheering? Visit the help article here. Q: Is Footy the Football a boy or a girl football? Yes! Q: Who was the greatest Footballer who ever lived?

	('/en/2018/06/08/hgc-cheer-is-back-support-teams-and-unlock-exclusive-in-game-items-1a5b8a5adac8/','Jun 8, 2018 - By Emily Halpin. HGC Cheer is back! — Support teams and unlock exclusive in-game items. The Heroes of the Storm Global Championship is on a roll, and Cheering is here to help you make this season the best one yet. When you Cheer for your favorite team(s), you’ll summon a team-themed animated Cheermote to celebrate the moment and amplify your voice in chat. Every Cheer during HGC brings both you and the entire community closer to unlocking Cheering goals, which include items like in-game Loot Chests, mounts, and exclusive Twitch emotes. Even better: a portion of the revenue Twitch receives from sales of Bits you Cheer goes directly to the team you’re supporting. This is the second time we’ve partnered with Blizzard for HGC Cheer, so this year we’re taking it to the next level. Every few weeks, beginning Friday, June 8th, we’ll introduce more community goals and fresh items to unlock. There will be more loot than ever, but be sure to watch and Cheer regularly to support your favorite teams and unlock them before they disappear. Once new community items launch, the old ones are gone for good. Right below the video player on twitch.tv/blizzheroes, you can track team-specific and global community Cheering progress; check out your individual goals; and see leaderboards that highlight each team’s biggest superfan. HGC teams will not only feel the love from your Cheers, they’ll get to see themselves represented on Twitch and within Heroes of the Storm on unlockable team-branded banners, sprays, and badges. How it works: Be sure to link your Blizzard account to your Twitch account so you can claim your loot when items become available. Cheer for your favorite teams on the BlizzHeroes channel (or any of the international channels) during HGC events by clicking on the Nexus icon at the bottom of chat, selecting the team’s logo, adding the number of Bits and a custom message to cheer them on. Once Cheering goals are reached, the items will be automatically deposited in your Heroes of the Storm account, as long as you already have your account linked. Cheering will start with the HGC Mid-Season Brawl on Saturday, June 9. Fans can continue Cheering throughout the rest of the 2018 HGC season, including the HGC Finals at BlizzCon. For more details on the HGC Schedule, click here. Follow the BlizzHeroes channel to be notified when events go live. FAQ. Q. How much revenue does a team receive when Bits are Cheered for them? A. For each Bit Cheered for a team, that team and Blizzard (as the tournament organizer) receive the same amount of revenue share. Q. Which regions’ teams are supported for HGC Cheer? A. You can Cheer for HGC teams from all regions (North America, Europe, China and Korea). Q. How do I Cheer for a team? A. Click on the Nexus icon at the bottom of the chat window, select the team’s logo, add the number of Bits you want to use and a custom message to cheer them on. Q. Can I use the regular Cheer command (e.g. cheer100) during HGC? A. No, regular Cheers won’t work on the BlizzHeroes channel during HGC. You can Cheer for any or all of the 32 teams competing in HGC using their team-themed Cheermotes. Q. I forgot to link my Battle.net account before Cheering! Can I still get the items? A. Yes!

UPDATE (March 21, 2018): Extensions are now available on Twitch iOS and Android. Don’t forget to add mobile support for your Extension today. Since the launch of Extensions last September, we’ve been blown away by the community’s response and contributions. The Twitch developer community has created over 150 Extensions for streamers to use, and over 2000 of you have expressed interest in building more! Today, we’re excited to announce that we’re bringing Extensions to our Twitch mobile apps starting in late March. As more and more of the community accesses Twitch on their phones and tablets, enabling Extensions on mobile will significantly increase the reach of your Extensions while allowing streamers to share a consistent experience with their viewers across all platforms — this has been one of the most requested features from the streaming community. As promised when we shared our RFC (Request For Comments) on mobile Extensions, you’ll have a head start on building a mobile experience for your Extension, so that it’s mobile-ready by the time it rolls out to all Twitch app users. Starting today, you can access our design and technical guidelines to help you get started. So how does it work? Extensions with mobile support will occupy the same area as chat in our mobile apps. When a user watches a channel with a mobile Extension, they can view and interact with it after tapping on the Extensions icon. If the streamer has more than one Extension activated on their channel, the viewer can swipe left and right between multiple Extensions or navigate using the top tabs. Streamers will know which Extensions support mobile via a badge in the Extensions Manager. To enable your Extension on mobile devices, you’ll need to provide a mobile-specific front end file for your Extension. The Extension’s format on web (i.e. video overlay or panel) will not impact how the Extension is presented on mobile so you’ll want to think about how to develop a responsive experience. Over the next few days, you’ll be able to create a test version of your Extension, enable mobile support, and see that test version live in the Twitch app on version 5.10 or higher on Android and version 5.10.1 on iOS prior to the rollout to all Twitch mobile app users in late March. This is the first of many new features we’re working on to create access to Extensions in more places. We’ll share more about our roadmap in an upcoming live stream on March 13, and we’d love to answer your questions and hear your feedback — save the date! If you have any burning questions before then, please reach out to us in the forums or talk to other Twitch developers in the chat server! And of course, don’t forget to check out the documentation to get started developing mobile Extensions today.',486,'Get started building Extensions on mobile','

Custom Sub tenure badges for years 3–8 are coming in March for Partners, so get your badge art ready! Update on February 22, 2018: Partners and Affiliates can now adjust settings for Top Cheerers ahead of its launch next week in the Cheer section of your Channel Settings on the Dashboard. Also available now are the 10 new Bits badges above 1 million Bits. Lastly, we heard your feedback and are happy to announce coming in March, Partners will be able to upload custom Subscription tenure badges for 3–8 years. Our thanks to everyone who shows support for streamers by subscribing and Cheering with Bits! Over the years we’ve seen all sorts of creators and viewers connect through Twitch. After all, one of the things that makes Twitch unique is the back and forth between streamer and viewer. Tuning in to watch and chat with a favorite creator is always appreciated, but some viewers also Cheer with Bits or share amazing clips with the world. Those viewers deserve to be recognized by creators and their communities, so today, we’re upping the ante for those who go above and beyond. This one is for the fans. Make room for Clip Champs, rolling out today, and Top Cheerers, coming soon™. Also, try saying that first part five times fast. Clip Champs is a new way to recognize top clippers who consistently create and share quality clips of their favorite creators. Viewers who create clips for a specific channel across four distinct weeks in a month and have over 50 combined views on those clips will receive the exclusive “Clip Champ” chat badge. Clip Champs will also have their status appear on other parts of Twitch where clips are found, such as on clips viewing pages and clips tabs of a channel or game page. For more details on Clip Champs and how to become one, check out our help article. At launch, those who qualify as a Clip Champ based on their clipping history in December and January will be notified of their Clip Champ status. Maybe Cheering is more your style? Top Cheerers, as you may have guessed from the very obvious name, is a pinned leaderboard that displays the top three Cheerers in the channel at the top of chat. The leaderboard can also be expanded to show the top 10 Cheerers, as well as your current position. Viewers that Cheer enough to make it to the top 3 will unlock access to special chat badges. Behold! Top Cheerers is launching at the end of this month, so stay tuned. Lastly, we’ve got something for those of you who have Cheered the loudest. We’re introducing these 10 beautiful new Bits badges for all of you who have Cheered above 1 million Bits. You’ll start seeing these badges appear at the end of this month. However you support your favorite creators, thank you for being a part of the community. Wear those badges with pride, and we’ll see you on the leaderboards. FAQ. How can I track my progress toward becoming a Clip Champ? We are currently actively exploring ways to provide viewers with a simple method for tracking their progress toward becoming a Clip Champ. In the meantime, viewers can use the Clips Manager to see the number of views for their clips. I’m a Twitch creator. What are the benefits of having Clip Champs for my channel? Clips is a simple way for any viewer to help your channel grow by reaching and engaging audiences with short, bite-sized videos that showcase exciting, interesting moments from a creator’s content. Clip Champs are viewers who consistently create and share engaging clips, so the more Clip Champs are a part of your community, the more viewers you have who can support you by curating the best of your content to new and existing audiences. How often does Clip Champs status reset? Clip Champs statuses reset monthly. Users are notified of achieving Clip Champ status on the first of the month, and the status lasts until the end of that month. If I make one of the top 3 spots for Top Cheerers and unlock a badge, how long do I get to keep it? If you unlock a Top Cheerer badge, you keep it for as long as you keep that ranking. If you are in the #1 spot and someone overtakes you, they will get the #1 badge right away, and you will then have the #2 badge until and unless someone overtakes you in the #2 spot. If the creator has Top Cheerers set to “Weekly,” the leaderboard resets every 7 days at which point all 3 badges disappear until someone Cheers enough to take one of the top 3 spots. Once Top Cheerers launches, what happens to Pinned Cheers (Pin Top Cheer and Pin Recent Cheer)? Top Cheerers replaces Pin Top Cheer, making it possible to recognize many more Cheerers rather than just one. Pin Top Cheer will no longer be available. Pin Recent Cheer will still be available and will work the same as before. As a Partner or Affiliate, can I reset Top Cheerers at any time? If you have Top Cheerers set to “Weekly,” it will automatically reset every 7 days. If you have it set to “All-Time” to show the top Cheerers of all time, there is no reset. If someone is banned from my channel, can they still show up in Top Cheerers? No. Viewers that have been banned will not show up in Top Cheerers.',987,'Earn new rewards for supporting your favorite creators','

Bust out those ugly sweaters, celebrate the holidays, and spread joy on Twitch by Cheering to support streamers. Cheering already has plenty of benefits on Twitch, like celebrating special moments with streamers, amplifying your voice in chat, and earning Bit badges, but from now through December 26th, Cheering will do even more. Let’s break it down. If you Cheer 1 to 249 Bits to support streamers during this time, you’ll also receive a Holiday Gift containing a full set of seven seasonal emotes. If your favorite streamer is on the Nice list and you Cheer 250 Bits or more, you’ll instead receive a Gold Holiday Gift containing a different complete set of seven seasonal emotes and share a special gift for a number of the other viewers in chat: one of the holiday emotes! We also have a brand new Holiday Cheermote that’s perfect to use this holiday season. Once you receive the holiday emotes, you’ll find them in the emote selector for Chat, Pulse, Feeds, and Whispers so you can truly spread joy all across Twitch. If you need to fill your gift-giving hands with Bits, load up here. Questions? We’ve got answers. Q: When exactly is this happening? Starting now and ending 12PM PDT on December 26. Q: Do streamers still receive the same revenue share from Twitch for the Cheer/Bits? Yes. Q: How long can I use the seasonal holiday emotes? Until the end of January 2018. Q: What exactly is in the Holiday Gifts? All regular Holiday Gifts contain all seven of the first set of seasonal holiday emotes. Similarly, all Gold Holiday Gifts contain all seven emotes of the second set. Q: Are the emotes I receive randomly selected? No, all regular Holiday Gifts contain the same first set of seven seasonal holiday emotes and all Gold Holiday Gifts contain the same second set of seven. Q: How are the holiday emotes awarded? Cheer between 1–249 Bits and you will receive a regular Holiday Gift containing the first seven seasonal holiday emotes. Cheer 250 Bits or more and you’ll receive a Gold Holiday Gift, containing another set of seven seasonal holiday emotes. You’ll also activate a gift for a number of other viewers in chat who will receive one of the 14 emotes. Q: Can I Cheer 125 Bits now and 125 Bits later and receive a Gold Holiday Gift? No, you have to cheer with at least 250 Bits in one single Cheer to be able to receive a Gold Holiday Gift. If you did the above, you’ll receive a regular Holiday Gift for the first Cheer only. You won’t receive another regular Holiday Gift for the second Cheer but it will still support the streamer and contribute towards Bit Badges as normal. Q: If I Cheer with 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, etc. Bits in a single Cheer, do I receive multiple Gold Holiday Gifts? You’ll receive one Gold Holiday Gift for the single Cheer which contains all seven of the second set of holiday emotes. Q: If I Cheer 250 Bits and receive a Gold Holiday Gift and then later on Cheer another 250 Bits, will I receive a second Gold Holiday Gift containing duplicate emotes? You only receive the Gold Holiday Gift containing the seven seasonal holiday emotes for the first Cheer. You won’t receive another Gold Holiday Gift for the second Cheer but it will still support the streamer and contribute towards Bit Badges as normal. Q: I received one of the holiday emotes from another person’s Cheer and afterwards received a duplicate holiday emote from one of the Holiday Gifts, did something go wrong? This is expected since the holiday emote you received is from the pool of 14 holiday emotes of which the Holiday Gifts are guaranteed to have their respective seven emotes. Q: Where do I find my Holiday Gifts if I don’t open them right away? On your Inventory page at twitch.tv/inventory. Q: Where do I get more Bits? Bits.twitch.tv. Q: What are Bits and Cheering?

The Game Awards are making a return this Thursday, December 7. Of course, just like previous years, you can watch the whole show at 5:30pm PT on Twitch and debate Game of the Year, Best Narrative, and all the other categories with tons of other gamers in chat. And this year, we’re stepping things up with a next-level experience. First, anyone can co-stream The Game Awards on their own personal Twitch channel. Whether you want to add your own colorful commentary or just keep chat clear for your community, this option is for you. It’s super easy, and we’re including the full details on how to co-stream The Game Awards below. Second, we’ve created an interactive, only-on-Twitch experience that lets your community predict category winners before they’re announced via a custom overlay Extension right on your channel. If you’re co-streaming The Game Awards, all you need to do is activate the Extension. After that, it’s up to you and your community to vote on who you think will take home the award. The community that predicts winners with the highest accuracy will win an exclusive chat badge for a month and all associated bragging rights. If you have predictions on Best RPG, Most Anticipated Game, Trending Gamer, and more, this one is for you. Okay. Here’s how to do all that cool stuff we just mentioned: How to co-stream The Game Awards. Set your favorite broadcast software to capture the stream live on twitch.tv/thegameawards. Set your “game” to The Game Awards 2017. Use the hashtag #thegameawards to Tweet about your co-stream. How to install and use the custom Game Awards Extension. __Go to the Extension Manager on your dashboard to activate “The Game Awards 2017: Community Predicts” Extension (available here!). The moment you activate the Extension, you’ll “create” a new community. There’s no need to do anything else. Viewers will be able to vote for who they think will win each category directly from your co-stream, and also see how the community is tracking in real-time. If you’re new to co-streaming, fear not. We have a few tips ready from Twitch veterans: “When co-hosting, your job is to add value to the event that is being produced for you. Have an idea how you will contribute, be it commentary, jokes, or something else. You don’t have control over what’s being shown, so try not to have too much of a rigid schedule and talking points.” — Tucker (iijeriichoii). “Co-hosting on Twitch is an invitation to broadcasters to experience gaming news with their audience the second it is announced. Keep in mind, portions of your audience might not know what to expect, so being knowledgeable about what might be shown can help build up the excitement. While it’s important to add your own voice and sometimes camera to the broadcast, don’t take away from the stream itself. Otherwise, your audience might go elsewhere!” — jp (itmeJP). The Game Awards are kicking off Thursday, December 7 at 5:30pm PT at /TheGameAwards. Mark your calendars so you don’t miss the show, and once it starts, check out the Game Awards directory for a full list of streamers co-streaming the event. Twitch is excited to work with various Productions, Studios, and Events to offer co-streaming as an option to our broadcasters. However, not everything on Twitch is available for co-streaming and we suggest that broadcasters ensure the events they’d like to co-stream are available to do so prior to going live.

Yes, you can gift a subscription at all three price points: $4.99, $9.99 or $24.99. Does a gifted sub count towards sub tenure? In other words, would a gifted sub extend my sub tenure if I canceled my sub but were still within the grace period for sub tenure? A. Yes, a gifted sub will preserve/continue your sub tenure. If I receive a gift sub to a channel I’ve never subbed to before, and after the gifted month I decide to continue the sub, does my tenure start at month one or month two? A. Your tenure would start at month two, because gifted subs count toward sub tenure. Can I buy a subscription to a channel for which I was gifted a sub? A. Yes, you can! When you have an active gift subscription to a channel, you can purchase a subscription either using the subscription button in the upper right of the video player, or on your subscription management page. You will not be charged until after your gift subscription ends. I tried to give someone a sub, and the Gift a Sub button is greyed out. Why? A.

Upgrades are not currently available through Subscription Gifting. Can I buy someone a recurring sub? A. Not at the moment. Gift subscriptions last one month. Can I decline to receive a gifted subscription? A. When someone gifts you a sub, you will automatically receive the subscription, and the Partner or Affiliate subscribed to will receive the support from that subscription. You may choose to disable the subscription benefits if that channel does not suit you, but we want to make sure the support still goes to that streamer, as the gifter intended. You can disable Gift Subscription benefits from your Subscriptions management page. Are gifted subscriptions refundable? A. No. All purchases are final. How about team subscriptions? A. Subscription Gifting is not available for team subscriptions at this time. Can I gift a sub from the mobile apps or from subs.twitch.tv? A.

Celebrate QuakeCon with Twitch Prime loot, Twitch Drops, and the Champions Pack! Bethesda and Twitch are teaming up to bring you a variety of awesome new content! From Twitch Prime in-game loot and Twitch Drops to being able to purchase Quake Champions on Twitch directly, we’ve got you covered and even better yet, the Twitch Prime promotion is now extended until October 9th! Here to explain in more detail is guest blogger Tim Willits! Hello, Tim Willits here, Studio Director at id Software and Game Director on Quake Champions. I’m excited to announce our partnership with Twitch and reveal our exclusive Quake Champions items created only for Twitch Prime members. We also have some exciting news about Twitch Drops and the fact that you’ll be able to purchase the Champion’s Pack (with all current and future Champions) on Twitch directly. But first let me talk about Quake Champions. Quake Champions is our newest game in the storied Quake franchise. It’s a multiplayer-only arena shooter, built in the spirit of fast, competitive action, where you’ll have the ultimate playground to prove your FPS skills against players from around the world. For people who may not know, the original Quake game was the very first true 3D action game, released twenty years ago. The original Quake helped shape modern first-person shooters with its intense speed, crazy weapons, and incredible multiplayer, and today, Quake Champions continues that tradition of groundbreaking innovation with cutting-edge graphics, unique gameplay, and over-the-top action. Quake also has a long history of players recording “frag videos” and streaming their games online. Even in the earliest days of Quake, players found a way to share their experiences with friends and other fans. Back then, fans had to work pretty hard to make this happen. But today, Twitch makes that all so much easier. Thanks to Twitch, our Quake players can easily reach millions of fans and connect directly with their followers, showing off their greatest plays and all of their incredible matches. The Twitch community has become a critical component to Quake Champions, and we’re excited to see how our players and fans use Twitch to share their experiences and express themselves in fun and creative ways. To show our appreciation for both Twitch and our fans, the Quake Champions team has created some really cool, exclusive items, just for Twitch Prime members: ● The Exclusive “Twitch Rocket Launcher” — The Rocket Launcher is the most powerful weapon in the game, and now you can Rocket Jump and gib your opponents with an exclusive, Twitch-purple weapon skin. ● Twitch Name Plate and Profile Icon — Customize your profile and let everyone in the Arenas know you’re a proud Twitch Prime member. ● Three In-Game Crates — Each Crate gives you 2 random, high-quality items, like unique skins and shaders for your weapons or Champions. Starting today, you’ll also be able to buy the Champions Pack on Twitch, which gives you access to all 11 current Champions, including Ranger, Visor, Scalebearer, Nyx, Anarki, Clutch, Sorlag, Galena, Slash, BJ Blazkowicz from id Software’s Wolfenstein, and the new DOOM Slayer. The Champions Pack also includes all future Champions, including at least six additional Champions expected to release before the endof 2018, and any that follow. That’s not all, when you buy the Champions Pack you’ll also get an exclusive Early Access skin for series diehard Ranger, and Three Reliquaries (loot chests containing three in-game items for profile, Champion, and weapon customization, like skins, shaders, nameplates, and more). If that’s not enough awesomeness for you, for every pack you buy, you’ll get to unlock a Twitch Crate, which will come loaded with bits, badges and custom emotes! We’re also excited to announce that fans who watch the Quake World Championship or any of your favorite Quake streams on Twitch will have an opportunity to win Loot Drops. All you need to do is link your Twitch and Bethesda.net accounts and start watching Quake on Twitch for a chance to get in-game loot such as backpacks, chests, and reliquaries. The more you watch, the more you can win! Lastly, I want to thank all of our fans who have supported Quake for the last twenty years, it is you, the Quake fan, that humbly inspire us to make Quake Champions the best game we can. I look forward to seeing you all fragging away online! Thank you, Tim Willits and the entire Quake Champions Team. What is Twitch Prime?

In April we announced that fans could now buy the games that they love directly on Twitch, while supporting streamers and earning Twitch exclusive loot with each purchase. Today, we are excited to share a brand new way to discover the games that are available for sale on Twitch. Now there is a new way to help you keep up with all the new games, Twitch Crate offers (sometimes we like to celebrate by letting you get 2x the crates) and any exciting Twitch exclusive in-game content that we have available for you (like the Warframe Prominence bundle). Check it out by going to www.twitch.tv/store/games. Exciting games will be highlighted in the top rotating banner. Any special promotions we run will also be easily shown on this page. If you want to keep up with the latest titles, you can always see new games that are available for sale in the “What’s New” section, or check out our “Popular Section” to see what games and in-game content are getting love from the community. Why Buy On Twitch? When you buy a game or in-game item from your favorite streamer’s page, they will get 5% of the revenue. If that weren’t enough, for any purchase of $4.99 or more, you will also get a Twitch Crate. Twitch Crates come loaded with random rewards like bits, badges and emotes for you to use across Twitch. You can open them right away or hoard them for later in your inventory page. The emotes and badges in Twitch Crates range from common to very rare. Several games have custom emotes as well, and if one is available for the game or in-game content you just purchased, you’ll to get that in your Twitch Crate too.',311,'A new way to keep up with games you can buy on Twitch','

Update (8/24/17): In-game items are now ready to be claimed. Please welcome HGC Cheer to the Nexus! The Heroes of the Storm Global Championship (HGC) Clashes are fast approaching, and we’re excited to announce you’ll be able to Cheer for your favorite teams on Twitch using custom Cheermotes — while earning sweet loot along the way. When you Cheer for your favorite team(s) you summon a team-themed animated Cheermote to celebrate the moment and amplify your voice in chat. A portion of the revenue Twitch receives from the Bits Cheered goes directly to the team. Progress will be tracked for number of Bits Cheered by each individual, for each HGC team, and all Bits Cheered collectively across all teams. Items like Heroes of the Storm Loot Chests, mounts, and exclusive in-game emotes will unlock when Cheering goals are reached. A dedicated HGC Cheer event page will track team-specific and global progress while individual leaderboards will highlight each team’s biggest superfan. HGC teams will not only feel the love from your Cheers, but will get to see themselves represented on Twitch and within Heroes of the Storm on team-branded banners, sprays, and badges that you can unlock. How it works: Be sure to link your Blizzard account to your Twitch account so you can claim your loot when items become available. Cheer for your favorite teams on the BlizzHeroes channel during HGC events by clicking on the Nexus icon at the bottom of chat, selecting the team’s logo, adding the number of Bits and a custom message to cheer them on. Track your individual and global progress on the HGC Cheer Event Page. Once Cheering goals are reached, earned items will appear as “Claimable Soon” on the HGC Cheer Event Page. Once they are available, they will appear as ‘Claimable’. Clicking on Claimable items will apply them to your account. Cheering will start with the HGC Western Clash on Friday, August 4, followed shortly after by the Eastern Clash starting Friday, August 11. Fans can continue Cheering throughout the rest of the 2017 HGC season (League Play, Playoffs, and Crucible), including the HGC Finals at BlizzCon. For more details on the HGC Schedule, click here. Follow the BlizzHeroes channel to be notified when events go live. __In case you’re looking for even more goodies, don’t forget Twitch Prime members will be able to redeem even more special rewards in August for Heroes of the Storm. Currently, Twitch Prime members can get an Overwatch® Golden Loot Box containing a guaranteed legendary item, along with three additional in-game items like emotes, voice lines, or character skins. For more information, a free trial, and more loot for select Blizzard games, visit www.twitchprime.com.*. Burning Questions. Q. Where can I keep track of the Bits Cheered and items unlocked during the event? A. When HGC Cheer starts in early August, there will be an Event tab on the BlizzHeroes channel where Cheers will be tracked. Q. How much revenue does a team receive when Bits are Cheered for them? A. For each Bit Cheered for a team, that team receives one half of one cent. Blizzard receives one half of one cent as the tournament organizer. Q. Which regions’ teams are supported for HGC Cheer? A. North America, European Union, China and Korea. Q. How do I Cheer for a team? A. Click on the Nexus icon at the bottom of the chat window, select the team’s logo, add the number of Bits you want to use and a custom message to cheer them on. Q. Can I use the regular Cheer command (e.g. cheer100) during HGC? A. No, regular Cheers won’t work on the BlizzHeroes channel during HGC. You can Cheer for any or all of the 32 teams competing in HGC using their team-themed Cheermotes. *Twitch Prime offer valid only in regions where Twitch Prime is available. Must own Overwatch to redeem Twitch Prime offer for Overwatch Loot Box. Loot Box does not include seasonal event items. Content of Loot Box is random.

As always, we’ve got a boatload of incredible things planned like meet and greets, live shows, tournaments, and of course, a party. This year, we’re planning something special every night of the show so you and your friends can bring home more memories than ever before. Today, we’re excited to share our plans for Saturday night. In the spirit of the Halloween season, TwitchCon will be taking over the nearby Queen Mary: Dark Harbor on Saturday night, 10/21, for an epic party.

And, because we love you, all 3-day and Saturday badge holders will have free admission to the party. You can check out the official Dark Harbor site to see videos and pictures from last year’s event and get a peek at what you’ll be in for.

You must have your 3-day or Saturday TwitchCon badge present to gain admittance.**. **Entry is permitted on a first come, first served basis determined by venue capacity.

Children between the ages of 6 and 13 must be accompanied by an adult with a TwitchCon badge. Children under 6 do not need a badge of their own. Q: Is Dark Harbor wheelchair accessible?

Q: What are the mazes? Dark Harbor is pleased to unveil Intrepid, a sizzling trip through time back to the ship’s origins in Scotland at the John Brown Shipyard to tell the tale of The Iron Master. There are a total of six ultra long mazes including Lullaby, Soulmate, Deadrise, B340 and Circus. They will leave you screaming for more! See all the mazes. Q: Can I bring my own food into the event?

	('/en/2017/06/08/announcing-the-twitch-partner-server-d9cc110165c0/','Jun 8, 2017 - By Brian Petrocelli. Announcing the Twitch Partner Server. Each day at Twitch we ask ourselves the question, “How can we better serve our Partners?” In that spirit, this year we’ve launched a ton of new initiatives designed to better serve the Partner community: tiered subs, new tools for Bits, Partner badges, product councils, and event mixers. The results have been tremendous. Partners share their insight with Twitch and Twitch Staff build better products and features. The collective response from Partners and staff alike has been a resounding, “We want more!” So today, we are excited to announce the new Twitch Desktop App Partnerships Server! Now there is one central place for news, announcements, and feedback. I know some of you are thinking, “But Citizen, there’s already a Twitch Partner Discord?” Don’t worry; the Partner Discord isn’t going anywhere. But sometimes we can’t share announcements that we’d like to because the server is too open. Creating a server in the Twitch Desktop App allows us to verify that the server is 100% composed of current Twitch Partners and staff. That means we can share more with you earlier, which has the added benefit of making Partner feedback even more impactful on our efforts. So, how do you join? Partners will receive a prompt when opening the desktop app to join the server (grab the app here if you don’t already have it installed). If you dismiss the prompt by mistake, head to your Account Sync settings to join.',251,'Announcing the Twitch Partner Server','

	('/en/2017/06/07/now-buy-games-to-support-affiliates-ea98c8882fd7/','Jun 7, 2017 - By Robin Fontaine. Now, buy games to support Affiliates! Get double Twitch Crates on all purchases this week! When we launched the Affiliate Program last month, our goal was to help support the thousands of hardworking and talented streamers out there that hadn’t yet made Partner. But we didn’t foresee just how positive the impact would be for so many streamers and their communities. Zhylaw, now a Twitch Affiliate, said it best: “As someone who has been around on Twitch from when Justin.TV still existed, I say with no exaggeration this is the greatest thing Twitch has done since the Partner program itself first started. For myself and many others, it’s not even about potential “money” but the official community and company recognition of being more than a viewer but a “content creator” and a member of “the family” as it were.” Support Affiliates with Game Purchases. We’re thrilled to welcome so many streamers into the family and to continue building the program with new ways to support Affiliates. Speaking of which… we’re proud to announce that, starting today, Affiliates can earn revenue from sales of games and in-game items originating from their channel page. Currently, when any streamer is playing a game that’s available for sale on Twitch, you can buy the game or in-game items using a purchase button that will appear on that channel page. We’re constantly adding new games to our catalogue, and working to bring you exciting things like the Twitch exclusive Warframe Prominence bundle, or Smite’s Bob Ross skins. Until now, only Partners were eligible to receive a 5% revenue share from those purchases. Now, Affiliates are, too! Double Crates for 1 Week! ****To celebrate, we’re giving out double the Twitch Crates for the next 7 days. From now through June 14th, any time you buy a game or in-game item on Twitch for at least $4.99, you’ll earn not just one Twitch Crate, but two. This applies to purchases from any page on Twitch, not just Affiliate channel pages. That’s double the emotes, badges, or Bits you can get! Burning Questions. Q. Double Twitch Crates!?!?! How do I get in on that? A. Purchase any game or in-game item for at least $4.99 on Twitch between now and June 14th at midnight PST and you’ll get 2 Crates instead of the usual 1. To see a complete list of games available on Twitch, click here. Q. How do I know when a Partner or Affiliate is getting a 5% share of my purchase? A. When you see “Purchase revenue will be shared with [Streamer’s Twitch name]” to the right of the purchase button on the channel page, you can feel good knowing that Partner or Affiliate will receive a 5% revenue share of your purchase. Q. I’m an Affiliate. Do I have to do anything to be eligible to receive revenue from Game Sales? A. All Affiliates are automatically enabled to start earning from game sales starting today. You’re good to go! You just need to be playing a game that is available for sale on Twitch for a purchase button to appear on your channel page. Q. When will Affiliates get Subscriptions? A. Not just yet. We’re working on it!',542,'Now, buy games to support Affiliates!','

	('/en/2017/05/23/new-subscription-options-out-of-beta-and-into-a-channel-near-you-f6e6db81ae0d/','May 23, 2017 - By Robin Fontaine. New Subscription options: out of beta and into a Channel near you! Last month we launched a beta for new subscriptions that give you more choice when it comes to recurring support for your favorite partnered streamer. We introduced subs for $9.99 and $24.99 in addition to the familiar $4.99. Starting today and over the course of the next week, we will begin rolling out these new subscription options to all partnered channels. The tool developers Streamlabs, Muxy, and Bit Boss Battles worked with us during the beta to make sure the new sub options are recognized with cool new alerts and tools. Also, we’re making a few updates for subscriptions overall. 50 Emote Tiers for Partners. There are now 50 emote tiers instead of the previous 14, so emotes will unlock more gradually as each Partner’s subscriber community grows. Unlock Emotes Faster. Partners unlock new sub emotes based on their number of subscribers. The new options will help them unlock new emotes faster. While a $4.99 sub is worth just one count, the $9.99 sub is worth two subscriber counts, and the $24.99 sub is worth six toward the number of subscribers needed to unlock new emote tiers. Permanent Sub Emote Unlock. Once Partners unlock a new emote slot, it’s permanent! They won’t lose those emotes if their subscriber counts go down. One of the Partners who tried out the new Sub Options in the beta, Scrubing, had this to say: “My community LOVES the new sub options. My community is a very emote-orientated channel, so once my stream and regulars found out the higher priced subs help unlock emote slots faster, A LOT of people showed support for it. Since the beta started, we’ve unlocked three more emote slots (forever!), and for me as a broadcaster, that takes so much stress off of me having to worry about sub count.” said Scrubing. “For me as a viewer, I LOVE the $24.99 subscription. A lot of my streamer friends have also been pushing for more emote unlocks, so me having a chance to give them a $25 sub if they’re close to an emote tier makes me feel awesome!” We feel awesome helping partners like Scrubing unlock more emotes and worry less about subscriber count so he can have more fun with his community. Burning Questions. Q. I currently subscribe to a channel at $4.99. How to I switch over to $9.99 or $24.99? Do I need to wait til the end of my subscription cycle? A. You can switch over by going to the channel page, clicking the green ‘Subscribed’ button in the upper right corner, and selecting your new option. You do not need to wait til the end of the cycle, but there is no proration. You will be charged the new amount immediately, and will not receive any refund for the remainder of the $4.99 if your subscription month is not over. Q. I subscribe to a channel using a Twitch Prime free subscription. Can I switch over to $9.99 or $24.99, and how? Do I need to wait til the end of my subscription cycle? A. You can switch from the Twitch Prime free subscription at any time by going to the channel page, clicking the green ‘Subscribed’ button in the upper right corner, and selecting your new option. You do not need to wait till the end of the subscription cycle, but you will not get another free subscription to use until your 30 cycle is over. Q. I’m a partnered streamer. Do I need to offer new emotes to my community for the $9.99 and $24.99 subs? A. It’s optional, and we’d like you to do what’s best for your community. Are you interested in creating emotes for the additional subscriptions and help finding an artist to design badges for you? We recently put out a call on Twitter for artists to respond to our thread with work examples and a link to a portfolio. Check it out! Q. How do I send my custom message when I subscribe? A. When you subscribe to any channel for the first time, a ‘share’ button will appear at the top of chat. Click that button anytime you’re ready. It will stay there for 30 days. That button triggers any alert the Partner has set up, and also allows you to send your message. Q. When is sub gifting coming? A. We’re already working on it, and expect to start testing this within the next few months.',759,'New Subscription options: out of beta and into a Channel near you!','

The Twitch Verified Badge means that Twitch has verified the identity of the user who has the badge. When you see the purple checkmark in chat, you’ll know that user is the real deal. (That way you don’t confuse Summit1G with SummitlG when he drops into your chat!). All Twitch Partners will be automatically granted access to the Verified Badge. (Insert Oprah “You get a badge! and You get a badge!” meme here.) The Verified Badge uses the same the global badge slot shared by Twitch Prime, Turbo, Bits, or other badges received from a Twitch Crate opening, which means that the badge can be toggled on and off by the Verified user. This gives Verified users the option to go “incognito”. We will be developing a policy on which additional users might qualify for this badge in the coming months.',149,'The Verified Badge is here!','

Update: As of April 24, the Affiliate Program officially launched and invites started rolling out. Update: As of April 24, the Affiliate Program officially launched and invites started rolling out. See the announcement here. And now, something for our non-partnered streamers! Let’s give some love to all the streamers who make Twitch the amazing place that it is. Streaming can be difficult, especially when you’re doing it full time, or trying to. When you tune in for a stream, you become part of the epic moments and inside jokes. But when the camera is off, you won’t see that same person working a second job or troubleshooting equipment for hours. We have so much respect for these hard-working streamers and the dreams they pursue. That’s why we’re committed to being the leading platform in the world for content creators to make a living from their passions. To date, that commitment has extended only to streamers accepted into the Twitch Partner Program. But for every streamer that achieves partnership, there are thousands more striving toward that goal, many of them sharing amazing content with strong, passionate communities, but without access to on-platform tools that would allow their viewers to help support them. To those emerging streamers: we see your consistent work, and we think you deserve a leg up! Introducing the Twitch Affiliate Program, which helps us expand that commitment to include tens of thousands of non-partnered creators. The program allows eligible streamers to start earning income on Twitch while building their audience, and provides a stepping stone to bridge the gap between emerging streamer and Twitch Partner. At launch, Affiliates will be able to start using Cheering with Bits on their channel so their communities have an on-platform choice for showing support. In the coming months we will continue to invest in both our Affiliate and Partner programs to better support creators at all stages of their development. While Affiliates will eventually have access to basic versions of our tools including Subscriptions, Game Commerce and Advertising, we will continue developing additional features just for Partners that are tailored for nurturing the larger communities they manage. For example, when we launch Subscriptions for Affiliates in the future, Affiliates will have only 1 subscriber emote, whereas Partners will be able to unlock a full set of 50 subscriber emotes. Verified Chat Badge for Partners. To give our Partners an extra mark of distinction on Twitch, we are introducing a new Verified Chat Badge that will be granted to Partners on the same day we launch the Affiliate Program. Affiliate Invitation Process. When we launch, we will begin sending invitations to streamers who qualify via email, notification in the upper right corner of twitch.tv, and in the dashboard. Invitations will roll out gradually over several weeks, so for those that are hoping to join the program, please be patient and allow several weeks for all the invitations to go out. The Affiliate Program is launching very soon, so stay tuned for more news! Burning Questions. When will the Affiliate Program launch? A. Very soon! When it launches, we’ll announce it on Twitter from @Twitch and on our blog. How do I apply for the Twitch Affiliate Program? A. There is no application process. We will invite streamers who qualify for the program to sign up. How do I qualify to become a Twitch Affiliate? A. The criteria is likely to change over time as the program develops. At launch, we’ll be inviting non-partnered streamers who have: At least 500 total minutes broadcast in the last 30 days. At least 7 unique broadcast days in the last 30 days. An average of 3 concurrent viewers or more over the last 30 days. At least 50 Followers. How will I know if I qualify and if I do, where will I see an invite? A. When we launch, qualified streamers will be notified via email, Notification, and an announcement in the upper left corner of your dashboard. Also, once a streamer is invited, a message will appear in their dashboard on the Settings tab where they can sign up to join the program. The initial wave of invitations around launch will be staggered over a several weeks. New invitations will continue to go out every few weeks after launch as new streamers qualify for the program. Invitations will not be instant as soon as a streamer meets the criteria. It will take a few weeks, so please be patient! Will Affiliates receive revenue from Bits on their channel? A. Twitch will provide participating Affiliates a share of the revenue Twitch receives from Bits equal to 1 cent per Bit used to Cheer for them, subject to certain terms and conditions such as our Bits Acceptable Use Policy.

UPDATE: As of April 4, 2017 at 11am PT, Twitch Crates are live, along with the ability to buy games and in-game content on Twitch! Learn more here. About a month ago, we announced you’d soon be able to buy PC games and in-game content directly on Twitch. That day is fast approaching! We also dropped some tantalizing hints about Twitch Crates, and now it’s time to lift the lid and show you what they’re all about. The juicy details: Any purchase on Twitch of a game or in-game item worth $4.99 or more will earn you a Twitch Crate. Think of these as your own personal treasure chests filled with loot. You can open them right away or horde them for later in your inventory page. Each Twitch Crate contains random rewards like chat badges, emotes, or a surprise number of Bits. The emotes and badges in Twitch Crates range from common to very rare. Some games have custom emotes as well. If one is available for the game or in-game content you just purchased, you’ll get that in your Twitch Crate, too. Over time, we will add more variety to the content of Twitch Crates, including community generated items, store discounts, and more surprises. We can’t wait to see the first Crate opening shared with the community! FAQs. Q. How can I tell if my purchase includes a Twitch Crate? A. Any purchase of a game or in-game item on Twitch that costs $4.99 or more will earn you a Twitch Crate. Q: Can I earn multiple Twitch Crates for a single purchase? (Example: Does a $50 game get you 10 crates?). A. You can only earn one Twitch Crate per purchase. The purchase of a $50 game will get you one Twitch Crate. Q: Can I receive duplicate rewards from Twitch Crates? If so, what can I do with those extra items? A. It is possible to get duplicates of an emote or chat badge as you open your Twitch Crates. In this case, your inventory will only show one of that item. At this time there is no way to trade those duplicates.',368,'Twitch Crates are here!','

Ever since our first baby steps onto the internet, our goal has been to make Twitch the ultimate hub for gaming on the web. What started as a simple streaming platform has become a living, breathing social community. Soon we’ll be taking another step to further strengthen the community and benefit streamers and viewers alike. Twitch has always been the best place to watch, share, and play games. Soon, it will be the best place to buy games as well. So, how does this all work? People already use Twitch as a way to ‘demo’ games and get a feel for what they’re all about before committing to a purchase. Soon, when you watch a stream, you’ll see an option to purchase below the video on the channel page if the game or in-game content is available on Twitch. When you buy, if the streamer is a partner who has opted into the program, he or she gets a 5% share of the revenue. So now you can help support your favorite partnered streamers just by getting a game on their channel. And, purchases come with a special digital Twitch Crate filled with surprises! Surprises!? Indeed. Any purchase over $4.99 will earn you a Twitch Crate, a digital loot box with a special reward like a game-specific emote, a chat badge, or some Bits. The contents of each Crate are randomly generated so you never know what surprise will be inside. Get it on Twitch, soon… We’ll be rolling out this new feature shortly, so watch for more news coming your way. Happy streaming! Burning Questions. Q. When is this launching? A. Sometime in the spring of 2017. That’s, um, soon! Q. What is the rev share to partnered streamers? A. The standard agreement with partnered streamers is 5% of the revenue generated from the sale of games and in-game items that are purchased from their channel page. Q. I’m a partnered streamer. How do I opt in to receive revenue from this program? A. You can find instructions in this help article. Q. What regions is game purchase available in? A. Purchase is available worldwide and payments are made using an Amazon account. At launch, all pricing is in US dollars. We’ll add support for more currencies in the coming months. Q. How do I download games I get on Twitch? A. Games purchased on Twitch can be downloaded and played via the Twitch launcher, or through existing services like Uplay. Q. How many/which games will be available at launch? A. We’ll be talking more about the games in the next few weeks. We can say we’re proud to have the following game creators as launch partners: Ubisoft, Telltale Games, Digital Extremes, Hi Rez Studios, Double Fine Games, Fred Wood, 11Bit, Jackbox Games, tinyBuild, Raw Fury, Devolver Digital, Gambitious, Trion Worlds, Blue Mammoth Games, iNK Stories, Versus Evil, Proletariat, Paradox Interactive, Vlambeer and Campo Santo. Q. If I’m a non partnered streamer, can viewers buy games from my channel page? A. An offer to buy a game or in game content will appear on all streamer channel pages when a game is being played that is offered for sale by Twitch. Only partnered streamers will be eligible to earn revenue through this program.',557,'Coming Soon: Get it on Twitch!','

The Twitch community includes not only viewers and streamers, but also the game creators who provide incredible new adventures for them to experience together. The relationship between these three groups is what makes Twitch, Twitch. Now, we’re excited to announce a way that Twitch will bring them all closer together. Twitch has always been the best place to watch, share, and play games. Soon, it will be the best place to sell your games as well. For details, read on! To contact us about selling your games on Twitch, go dev.twitch.tv/commerce. Social discovery -> Engagement -> Purchase. Viewers have always used Twitch as a way to ‘demo’ games before they buy. Now we’ll be giving them a way to close the loop and buy a game or in-game items they’re interested in, when and where they discover it. It works like this: an offer to purchase will appear below the video when a streamer is playing a game that’s available through Twitch. Partnered streamers who opt in will receive a 5% rev share for these purchases, and viewers who buy will receive a digital Twitch Crate that contains a randomly generated reward like an emote, badges, or Bits for Cheering. That’s pretty much the definition of a win-win-win. Why Sell on Twitch? Your community is already on Twitch, having fun watching your game. When they’re ready to buy, why send them somewhere else and risk losing them? Help them buy your game or in-game content right when they want it the most. We’ll supply the Twitch Crates to give them extra perks when they do! We believe there is tremendous potential in our community-first approach to game discovery and sale. It allows streamers to play and promote games they authentically enjoy and be rewarded for helping fans find new content. The community will love supporting streamers they watch by shopping local, right from the channel page they’re already spending time on. These interactions create new motivations for purchase to bring you new and highly engaged players. We’re proud to be launching this spring with great game creators including Ubisoft, Telltale Games, Digital Extremes, Hi-Rez Studios, tinyBuild, Paradox Interactive, Trion Worlds, Vlambeer, and more. If you’re interested in finding out more or joining us later this year, contact us via dev.twitch.tv/commerce. Burning Questions. Q. How are game purchases fulfilled? A. Games can be downloaded and played via the Twitch launcher. Games and in-game items can also be fulfilled directly to developers’ ID systems via account linking. Q. What is the revenue share for publishers and streamers? A. Game creators will receive 70% of the revenue and Partnered Twitch streamers will receive 5% for sales originating from their channel pages. Q. Where on Twitch will information about my game be displayed? A. The first place Twitch viewers will see your game for sale is their favorite streamers’ channel page. From there, users will visit a game detail page that includes trailers, description, hardware requirements, etc. Q. In what regions is game purchase available? A. Purchase is available worldwide. Payments are made using an Amazon account. At launch, all pricing is in US dollars. We will add support for more currencies in the coming months.',544,'Coming Soon: Twitch Games Commerce','

Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands War Within The Cartel is scheduled to premiere on February 16th 2017 at 2pm PST. The promotional live-action short will spotlight the Santa Blanca cartel, a ruthless group that has turned Bolivia into a narco-state. War Within The Cartel will be streamed on Ubisoft’s Twitch channel (www.twitch.tv/Ubisoft) and will be immediately available on demand via Amazon Prime Video following the premiere. War Within The Cartel takes viewers inside the inner workings of the Santa Blanca drug cartel, controlled by the revered yet ruthless leader, El Sueño. In the aftermath of an attack on their compound, the organization’s senior leadership seeks out a traitor within their midst to exact deadly retribution. The action packed story culminates in the events leading up to the beginning of the game as an elite Special Forces unit, the Ghosts, is called in to dismantle the cartel. To prepare for the premiere of War Within The Cartel, fans can register at GhostRecon.com/Beta for a chance to play the Beta for Ghost Recon Wildlands and see what it truly takes to become a Ghost. War Within The Cartel is directed by Avi Youbian (The Walking Dead, Tainted Love) from a script by Evan Greene. The project is produced by Avi Youabian. Ryan Landels, and Steve Ecclesine, . Executive Producers are Roberto Orci (Star Trek, Transformers and The Amazing Spiderman), Jay Williams, Noam Dromi, and Orlando Jones (Madiba, American Gods).

Late last year we announced a partnership with Wizards of the Coast to make Twitch the exclusive streaming partner for Magic: The Gathering. Now, we’re excited to share more details about what this epic team up means for you. Let’s dig in, shall we? Expanded Streaming Schedule. First, and most importantly, you’ll be getting more and better live coverage throughout the year. In 2017, Twitch will stream at least 40 Magic events on twitch.tv/magic. That’s nearly twice as many compared to 2016. Here’s how the coverage is breaking down: Four Magic Pro Tour events. Magic World Championship. World Magic Cup. 32 Grand Prix events. Magic Online Championship. Super Sunday Series Championship. But we aren’t stopping there. Throughout the year we’ll continue to look for more opportunities to stream great Magic content from sources far and wide. And don’t forget to tune in this weekend for the new Standard format Pro Tour Aether Revolt, Feb 3–5, live from Dublin, Ireland. Subscriptions. Starting this week, you’ll be able to subscribe to the official Magic channel, twitch.tv/magic. And, of course, with a subscription comes some tasty bonuses like exclusive emotes and Planeswalker sub badge. Repeat subscribers will get leveled up sub badges as well. Ooh and ahh at the hotness. Subscribers can also expect even more goodies, like exclusive access to members of the Magic R&D team through subscriber-only Q&A’s in Twitch Chat, with additional subscriber-only chats with pro players and casters to come in the future. Next steps. The folks at Wizards have been working like mad to give Magic fans the ultimate live streaming experience and are always looking to make more improvements, so feel free to reach out to them on Twitter (@magicprotour and @wizards_magic), Facebook, or Tumblr with your thoughts.',305,'More Magic on Twitch, all year long','

With a cast of crazed characters, simple — but beautifully difficult gameplay, and a pulsing musical score RunGunJumpGun is a loud trippy mess of platforming goodness! The two-button setup is treacherously simple. One button will shoot your massive gun downwards, propelling you through the air. The other button shoots your gun forward, destroying anything that’s in your path! But there is no stopping in this beautifully surreal world; littered with deadly traps and soul-crushing obstacles around every corner. Players will have to constantly alternate between the two firing modes to maneuver through meticulously crafted levels where death is a promise — not a possibility.

From January 26th— January 30th, get the game Heavy Bullets as a bonus with your Twitch Prime membership! If you’re not a Twitch Prime member, you can sign up for a free trial at twitchprime.com. You can find the game here: Heavy Bullets. Heavy Bullets is a randomized FPS dungeon crawler where players make their way through a colorful maze, while protecting themselves from aggressive creatures and malfunctioning security devices. To succeed in Heavy Bullets, players will need to move carefully and make smart use of their bullets, items, and the environment! Rushing into new areas is the fastest way to get killed in the untamed wild of the neon corridors. You’ll begin each attempt to reach the mainframe with just six bullets for your revolver that must be picked back up after each shot and manually reloaded one by one — make them count! Throughout the game you’ll discover items and perks to aid you on your way to the mainframe. From homing bombs, coin magnets, and high heels — to a teleporter! Each item will change up your approach. Choose wisely as you can only carry one item unless, of course, you find a backpack. While death is permanent in Heavy Bullets, money you’ve deposited in the bank can live on for future attempts at reaching the mainframe. Make a deposit or withdrawal from one of many conveniently placed automatic banking machine throughout the facility, or just blow your cash on a shopping spree — it’s up to you! Invest in items like Life Insurance or a Last Will that, if carried during the time of your unexpected death, will save your money, bullets, bombs, and key-cards on your next attempt!

Twitch Prime and Ubisoft are collaborating to make the month before the launch of For Honor a special one for fans, Twitch viewers and streamers! During the upcoming beta from January 26–29, select Twitch streamers, and all community members that have registered to take part in the Beta, will be chosen to represent the three factions of For Honor in War of the Factions. Everyone selected to take part in the For Honor Beta will be competing to determine which faction reigns supreme, and you can track the progress of the war on the global leaderboards at: forhonorgame.com/war. When War of the Factions comes to an end, one faction will be crowned the winner, and rewards redeemable in the full game will be given to all beta participants (with special awards going to the victorious faction). Once For Honor launches, another crop of rewards will be delivered to Twitch Prime members starting February 14th! After For Honor is released, Twitch Prime Members will receive 10-day Champion Status, which comes with XP boosts that can be shared among friends along with more XP from crafting, more loot at the end of each match, and a special emblem they can use to customize their warrior.

Now that the dust has settled and life at Twitch HQ has returned to ‘normal’, the entire Twitch Team would like to humbly and sincerely thank everyone who attended and tuned in to TwitchCon 2016! Hosting the 35,000+ attendees at the San Diego Convention Center was a blast, and we were thrilled to see over 2.2 million of you tune in online over the course of the 3-day event. But the love didn’t stop there. Collectively, the Twitch Community bled purple all across Twitter by adding over 160,000 tweets about TwitchCon. There was a lot of tweet-worthy news announced during the Keynote Address and a lot of it launched during TwitchCon. We launched Twitch Prime, VOD uploads, chat badges, a Twitchified Curse app, increased transcode capacity, new ways to create and edit clips, with even more to come. For a full recap on our product announcements look no further than this very blog. Couldn’t make it to San Diego and want to see what it was like at the Con? Or maybe you just want to relive some of your favorite moments and scenes? Check out the entire album of edited photographs from our photographer Robert Paul. From the Kappa Theater to Creative Corner, there wasn’t a dull moment and you all looked beautiful. Charity Update. To celebrate the launch of Twitch Prime, Amazon ran a massive sub-drive benefiting GameChanger over the past week. We are happy to report that the community subscribed over 500,000 times during the drive raising $500,000 for this great cause. On top of that, Charity Plaza was packed all weekend with crowds watching over 70 Twitch streamers participate in the Tiltify Charity Decathalon. When all was said and done, the community raised over $55,000 for ten different charities. Thank you to all who donated and participated! Special thanks. TwitchCon couldn’t have been TwitchCon without our many amazing sponsors, including our three Presenting Sponsors, Xbox, truth, and Amazon Game Studios. Thank you for helping to make TwitchCon special. See you next year… Thank you again to everyone who helped make TwitchCon 2016 the success it was, and although San Diego is still fresh in our minds, we’re already hard at work planning next year’s event.

After the launch of Twitch Prime today, many of you had questions. We have answers! We will use this blog post to share the latest trending questions and answers about Twitch Prime. Q. If I have Twitch Turbo and Amazon Prime, should I cancel Turbo? A. If you already subscribe to both Turbo and Amazon Prime, you may want to consider canceling Turbo. All the benefits of Turbo are included in Twitch Prime, except that instead of a Turbo banner on your subscriptions page you will see a Twitch Prime banner. You can cancel your Turbo subscription here, and you can go to twitchprime.com to connect your Amazon and Twitch accounts and get started with Twitch Prime. Q. If I have Amazon Prime, how do I get Twitch Prime? A. If you already subscribe to Amazon Prime, you can get Twitch Prime instantly for no additional cost by linking your accounts at twitchprime.com. Q. How do I start using my free channel subscription and retain my subscription tenure/loyalty? Cancel autorenew on the subscription you want to switch over to using your free Twitch Prime subscription for. Within the next 30 days after that subscription expires, use your Twitch Prime free subscription on that channel, and your tenure will continue without interruption. Q. If I bought an extended Turbo subscription, can I switch to Twitch Prime and get a refund on the Turbo subscription for time I did not use? A. For a limited time, we will offer a refund on Turbo purchases if you already have subscribed to Turbo and purchased Twitch Prime as well. To request a Turbo refund, go here. Q. If I join Twitch Prime and Cancel Twitch Turbo, do I lose anything? A.

Q: How do I use Twitch Prime if there are multiple account holders in my household? A. Twitch Prime benefits can only be redeemed by the primary Amazon Prime account holder.

It is with great pride and a tear of joy in our eye that we present to you the newest product collaboration between Twitch and Amazon. Yes, you guessed it, Twitch Prime!!! Since the moment it was announced in 2014 that Amazon would acquire Twitch, you have been wondering how we would work with Amazon to bring value to the Twitch community. Well, we took our cue from you. Right after the acquisition there were Reddit posts and tweets asking when we would offer Twitch Prime: We thought about what that might look like, and set to work designing and building something that would benefit the whole community. We wanted to give you something filled with lots of cool free stuff that would make Twitch fans happy. We wanted to make it like a secret level that unlocks the best parts of Twitch and the best parts of Amazon, where members would feel like total bosses. So that’s what we did! What is Twitch Prime? Here it is: Twitch Prime is a new premium experience on Twitch that is included with Amazon Prime. As a Twitch Prime member, you get free game loot every month, like instant access to the newest Hearthstone hero, Tyrande Whisperwind, or the new indie game, Streamline. You also receive discounts on new-release box games sold by Amazon during the pre-order period and for the first two weeks after launch. And on Twitch, once you link your Amazon Prime account to your Twitch account, you get an ad-free viewing experience, exclusive emotes and chat badge, and one free channel subscription every 30 days. When Twitch Prime members use their free channel subscription every month, the streamer gets paid just like any other subscription, so this introduces a new way to help support the streamers you love, even if you’ve never subscribed before. Or, you can just use it for crashing subscriber-only chat rooms. Your choice, boss! :). If you don’t have Amazon Prime, you may not know that it also includes unlimited fast shipping on millions of items on Amazon. This doesn’t sound exciting until the moment you need to decide between going to the store for toilet paper and playing another round of Overwatch. Amazon Prime benefits vary by country, and may also include unlimited streaming of thousands of movies and TV shows, streaming music from a library of over a million songs, and more. Check out the full list of Amazon Prime benefits in: US, UK, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and Spain. You can try it for free for 30 days [right here](http://twitchprime.com), and when you do, you get all the Twitch Prime benefits instantly just by linking your Twitch account to your Amazon account. If you already have Amazon Prime, then you get Twitch Prime included at no extra cost, right now! All you have to do is link your Twitch account to your Amazon account here. Launch Events. We are celebrating the launch of Twitch Prime with two events: a 6-week long Hearthstone celebration, and a $1 million charity event with GameChanger Charity. · Hearthstone Event — September 30-November 6. Top Hearthstone players will be streaming and celebrating Hearthstone all month, explaining in depth the meta, playing exhibition matches, and more. Throughout the event, all Twitch Prime members get the newest Hearthstone hero, Tyrande Whisperwind, the Night Elf Priestess. · GameChanger Charity Event — September 30-October 5. We’re running a massive Twitch-wide subscription drive for charity, benefiting GameChanger Charity, a group who raises money and awareness for children with cancer and their families, while creating life-changing experiences. Twitch Prime will donate $100,000 to GameChanger for every 100,000 new subscriptions to any channel on Twitch, whether using the Twitch Prime free subscription or not, between Friday, September 30 and Wednesday , October 5, up to $1 Million. Remember that free channel subscription you get every 30 days with Twitch Prime?

But considering everything included with Twitch Prime, we hope you’ll consider upgrading. In regions where Twitch Prime is available (US, UK, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and Spain), we will no longer take new Turbo subscriptions, and instead will roll the following benefits into Twitch Prime: ad-free viewing across Twitch, exclusive emotes (the ones you get with Turbo, plus some new ones), an exclusive chat badge, and 60 days of video storage for past broadcasts. The chat badge is the Twitch Prime crown, not the Turbo badge. Q. For people in countries where Twitch Prime isn’t available, is Turbo still an option? A. Yes. If you live in a country where Twitch Prime isn’t available, you may still subscribe to Turbo. Q. If you have Amazon Prime already, what happens? A. If you already subscribe to Amazon Prime, you can get Twitch Prime instantly for no additional cost by linking your accounts at twitchprime.com. Q. If you have Turbo and Amazon Prime already, what happens? A. If you already subscribe to both Turbo and Amazon Prime, you may want to consider canceling Turbo. All the benefits of Turbo are included in Twitch Prime, except that the Turbo chat badge will be replaced with the Twitch Prime badge. You can cancel your Turbo subscription here, and you can go to twitchprime.com to connect your Amazon and Twitch accounts and get started with Twitch Prime. Q. What are the free game loot items available for Twitch Prime members at launch? A. There will be new loot available every month, so you have surprises in store all year. At launch the following are available: 9/30–11/6 — Hearthstone: The newest Hero in Hearthstone. Tyrande Whisperwind, the second priest class option for the game. 9/30–11/1 — Streamline, a new Indie game built from the ground up for broadcasters on Twitch to play with their viewers. 9/30–10/2 (TwitchCon Only) — Smite: Exclusive “Boss Ymir” skin. 9/30–10/2 (TwitchCon Only) — Paladins: Exclusive Bomb King Weapon Skin.',1237,'Be a boss on Twitch with Twitch Prime','

A lot went down at the TwitchCon 2016 Keynote Address and we’re here to bring you all the juicy details and new product announcements. Everyone has been hard at work and are proud to introduce some great new features, products and improvements, so read on! Twitch Prime. From the moment Twitch was acquired by Amazon, integrating Prime benefits specifically for Twitch was one of the most requested and talked about possibilities. And now we are happy to bring you Twitch Prime, the best deal for gamers, ever. Simply put, Twitch Prime is the new premium version of Twitch that comes free with every Amazon Prime membership. It includes similar perks to Turbo and all the benefits of Amazon Prime, free game loot, a free Twitch channel subscription every 30 days, and more… Find out everything you’ll get with a Twitch Prime membership. Curse + Twitch. Now that Curse has joined the Twitch family, it’s time for the Curse app to become a bit more…Twitchified. So, starting now, you can customize the Curse color schemes to one of many options, including our personal favorite, Twitch Purple. And when you link your Twitch ID to your Curse account, all global emotes will be made available and subscriber emotes will also be available to channel subscribers. Read more here. Transcodes. We’ve heard you! Our goal is to provide transcodes to every streamer on Twitch. We know streamers need these options to grow their audiences, and those audiences need them to enjoy the streams. Starting Monday, we are extending video quality options to even more non-partnered streamers and will continue to increase capacity over the next few months. All told, we expect to increase transcode capacity by over 10 times our current capabilities. Learn more about transcodes here. Loyalty Badges. As close-knit communities have grown around specific channels, many partners have been asking for ways to reward longer-term subscribers. Now we’re happy to announce a way to do just that. With Loyalty Badges, streamers can award special tenure-based badges for subs to celebrate subscription milestones. This feature will be launching in three weeks to allow Partners time to design and create Loyalty Badges that reflect the unique personalities of their communities. More details on Loyalty badges are hiding out here. Clips. We’re psyched to introduce two new ways to help you clip faster and easier than ever. Clips on Mobile: You can now create, view and share clips from both recorded videos and live streams right in the Twitch app. Clips on mobile is available on the latest version of the Twitch App on both iOS and Android right now. Read more on our Education portal. Clip Trimming: With the new clip trimming tool, you can edit out extra time from the start and end of a clip right when you create it. It’s super easy. Clip trimming will be available to everyone some time in October. Uploads. It’s no secret that the vast majority of the content on Twitch is streamed live. But that doesn’t mean that videos don’t play a big part in the community. We know that streaming live can be very challenging for some people and even the most dedicated streamer can’t stream all the time. As of today, any user can upload videos to Twitch for anyone to watch. Streamers may also download past streams and use the footage to create on-demand videos for their viewers to watch whenever they want. We’ve got a dedicated blog post right here.

What’s better than watching Twitch streamers competing for glory, fame, and bragging rights? If you said ‘watching them compete while suffering through brutal challenges in specially designed torture chambers’, then you’ve got a pretty twisted mind. You’d also be totally right. On the night of 10/1, Twitch is taking over Petco Park for TwitchCon: The Party, our biggest celebration ever. T-Pain, Darude, and a special mystery headliner will be performing live, but it all starts with the HP ‘Heroes of the Storm’ OMEN Challenge. Doors open at 5:30pm PDT. If you’re not familiar with the OMEN Challenges, this is how it’ll go down. Four teams of Twitch streamers will go head to head in Heroes of the Storm using brand new Omen X Desktop machines. They’ll battle not just each other, but whatever mysterious challenges await them inside their torture chambers. And the best part of all? Twitch Chat will vote on who gets tortured, live. Here’s what happened at the last OMEN Challenge… If you can’t make the party in person (boo!) you can watch live and vote on who gets tortured at twitch.tv/omenbyhp. A special event like this needs a very special lineup of competitors, and our challengers are some of the best and most popular on Twitch. White Wolves: Voyboy, Reynad27, Soma, KittyPlaysGames, FuturemanGaming. Purple Panthers: JoshOG, TrumpSC, Bajheera, lolRenaynay, DansGaming. Blue Badgers: Seltzer, GoldGlove, itsHafu, Brotatoe, GiantWaffle. Red Roosters: MaximusBlack, FemSteph, BMKibler, VernNotice, Sevadus.

	('/en/2016/08/08/improving-chat-rendering-performance-1c0945b82764/','Aug 8, 2016 - By Ben Swartz. Improving Chat Rendering Performance. Chat is a core part of the Twitch experience. Rendering new chat lines dozens of times a second on the client turns out to be a very difficult task. As Twitch has grown, the number of chat lines that are rendered has increased. Along with the increasing quality of video and complexity of the chat feature set, interacting with the core Twitch experience has resulted in occasional frame drops. Over the past couple months, I could constantly be seen around the office making the NotLikeThis face as I attempted to watch streams. I knew something had to be done. For the client side of our website, we use Ember. Our chat backend, a service we call “TMI”, sends each chat message in a given room to subscribed clients. From there, we generate a list of messages and render a message-line component for each message in that list. We also allow for 60fps video on our site. This means that if we want to prevent video streams from skipping frames, rendering and painting of video and chat messages needs to occur within 16.667ms — a tall order. When I started this investigation, additional messages were taking over 200ms of render time. TMI allows for tens of messages per second to go through the system, meaning that in the worst case we were skipping a ton of frames. The end result was choppy video for many streams with an active chat. Methodology. When we started investigating these issues, we wanted to see how long it took for a given message to render and how long it took for the first 100 lines to appear on the page. We used a test channel, which has both a high quality 60fps stream and the maximum limit of chat messages per second. We used the Chrome Developer Tools to look into how long render events were taking and we used ef4’s initial-render-perf along with some R to programmatically come up with render performance data. Solutions. Batching Message updates. The first thing we noticed was that there was no need to render message lines the moment we received them from the chat backend. If we just buffered and batched the message updates for a given time frame — say every 100ms — we would reduce the number of render events by a significant number. This was the first performance change we made. Whenever we received a message from TMI on the client side, we buffered that message into a queue. When 100ms passed by, we pushed all messages from that queue into the list of messages that the message-line template was bound to. In busy chat rooms this halved the amount of time it took to render lines. Instead of rendering multiple times causing 100–200ms render events, we reduced it down to a single render event every 100ms. This meant that even in really fast chats, we reduced the amount of frame skips. Removing extraneous component calls. In Ember, each additional component you render increases the time to render. Our initial template for chat looked like the following: {% raw %} // chat/chat-display.hbs {% endraw %} {% raw %} {{#each messages as |message|}} {{chat/chat-line msgObject=message ... }} {{/each}} {% endraw %} Where chat/chat-line.hbs looked like: {% raw %} // chat/chat-line.hbs {% endraw %} {% raw %} {{#if isWhisper}} {{chat/whisper-line msgObject=msgObject ... }} {{else}} {{chat/message-line msgObject=msgObject ... }} {{/if}} {% endraw %} Now generating that chat/chat-line component every time added time to render. One quick fix that Robert Jackson, Ember Core Team member and Twitch engineer, took advantage of was pulling up that conditional into chat/chat-display.hbs: {% raw %} // chat/chat-display.hbs {% endraw %} {% raw %} {{#each messages as |message|}} {{#if (eq message.style ''whisper'')}} {{chat/whisper-line msgObject=message ... }} {{else}} {{chat/message-line msgObject=message ... }} {{/if}} {{/each}} {% endraw %} With this realization in mind I went on a mission to remove extraneous component calls. Another common component use case was tooltips. For a very long time at Twitch, we have been using a jQuery addon called Tipsy to make nice looking tooltips. Tipsy is a pretty old piece of software that relies heavily on jQuery. One way that we made Tipsy maintainable in our Ember code base was by creating a tipsy-wrapper component around certain tags that would correctly create and destroy Tipsy when those elements were created and destroyed. Since we used Tipsy for both emoticon and badge tooltips, for each message, we could be invoking more than 10 tipsy-wrapper components. Each of these new components was adding 0.25–0.5ms to the total render time in Chrome on my i7 MacBook Pro. Our solution was one that our design team had wanted to use for a while: pure CSS tooltips. Pure CSS tooltips have a bunch of advantages: there’s no JavaScript to deal with, their styling is done in pure CSS, and there’s nothing to have to clean up — there is no risk of dangling tooltips. When we made this change, render times improved dramatically. As a bonus, our tooltips look much cleaner: Old: New: Removing Computed Properties. When I started looking deep into the stack trace of message-line renders, I realized that a lot of time was spent managing the dependencies of computed properties. Computed properties are instrumental to Ember for making sure that your templates are bound to model changes. In chat’s case, it’s pretty unlikely that the message’s underlying information is going to change while it’s still on the page. This means that message-line can effectively be a function from message object to HTML. Knowing that, we looked into removing computed properties from our message-line component. In order to keep our code looking familiar to developers already comfortable with computed properties, Robert Jackson made a Getter class that lazily calculates a value once, avoiding dependency bookkeeping and recalculation. This Getter class works nearly identically to ES6 getters but makes sure to include the constructor/teardown functions that Ember expects. This turned convenience computed properties like this one from this: {% raw %} // chat/message-line.js {% endraw %} {% raw %} systemMsg: computed(‘msgObject.tags.system-msg’, function () { return this.get(‘msgObject.tags.system-msg’); }), {% endraw %} To this: {% raw %} // chat/message-line.js {% endraw %} {% raw %} systemMsg: getter(function () { return this.get(‘msgObject.tags.system-msg’); }), {% endraw %} Removing computed properties was actually a pretty significant change. In time to render for 100 messages on our test channel, it reduced the time by over 10%. Going forward, it seems clear that for things that need to be very performant we should be very careful when we use computed properties. Next Steps. While I was able to accomplish a lot and increase performance by quite a bit, there’s still plenty more we can do. One of the things that is next up for us is upgrading to the newest version of Ember. During the course of these performance improvements, Robert Jackson found some V8 deoptimizations in Ember itself. He has since pushed these changes upstream, but we are waiting to clean up a few deprecations before we can upgrade (Ember Views — BibleThump). Another thing Matthew Beale, another Ember Core Team member, noticed while we were looking into things was that we are running code unimportant to chat rendering (user activity tracking) before allowing the browser to completely layout and paint chat lines: Moving these functions to a shared runloop if needed, or deferring them until after chat renders if possible, will minimize their competition with chat rendering and reduce the number of times that we skip frames. Finally, one huge takeaway from all of this is to reduce the amount of logic we put into rendering the chat. In an ideal world, the message-line component would be a simple function from a message object to HTML. We need to continue to be vigilant about keeping our message-line renderer side effect free and only calculate things when we need to. Things are looking better now, but there’s still plenty of work to do. We’re hiring engineers, so come join us if this sounds interesting!

When Cheering launched as a limited beta in June, we introduced a new way to celebrate with your friends in chat while showing support for content creators. We’ve tested our systems, collected great feedback from the community, and we’ve heard from hundreds of Partnered Twitch streamers across the globe that they want Cheering on their channels. And so, due to overwhelming demand, we are starting the transition to an open, opt-in beta so that Partners can enable Cheering in their channels whenever they’re ready. We’ll start with everyone in the US and UK on August 4th. By the end of August, we expect to welcome more European partners to join. Other countries will be added based on demand from Partners, and as we add local language support. We’re excited to see what the global community does with Cheering! One of the most frequently asked questions about Cheering is, “What are you doing next with it?” Since launch, we’ve made improvements including controls for Cheering in the Partner dashboard, a toggle for the Cheer Chat Badge, some new UX prototyped for EVO that we’ll refine and extend to other events, and UX optimizations you’ll see rolling out over the month of August. Next, we want to invest in ways for viewers to receive Bits via activities on Twitch, to make Cheering more accessible to everyone. We’ll start testing these ideas before TwitchCon. Although we are expanding Cheering to many more users on Twitch, it is still a beta. There is so much more to come for Cheering, and you’ll continue to see changes and improvements over time. So keep on Cheering, and keep telling us what you think here.',293,'Cheers! More Cheering across the US and UK','

It’s like Fight Club with cards, mics, and Twitch — use your mouth instead of fists! It’s actually nothing like Fight Club. A guest post from developer Pipeworks Studio in collaboration with 505 Games. My name is Amor Estandian, and I am the lead designer of Superfight digital! I’m here to offer insight on how to make a game with Twitch in mind and to discuss what it took to make Superfight an experience built to bring Twitch communities closer together. What’s Superfight? Superfight is a ludicrous video game based on the card game of the same name (bless you, Darin Ross). We wanted players who love the Superfight card game to be able to pick it up any time with friends online. We’re not attempting to replace the card game, but to provide a unique experience as an online game. Here’s how it works: Make Fighters — Players use cards to create a fighter. Abraham Lincoln? A manatee perhaps? Argue! Players debate (yell at each other) who wins, “Lincoln’s penguin army would overwhelm the bionic manatee!” Vote! Other players in-game and on Twitch vote on who wins. Convince your voters! This is where the real magic happens. “I can’t believe 72% voted for the manatee.” That’s it! Simple, right? It’ll feel that way in game, but making Superfight had substantial considerations. How do you take a game that centers on a verbal argument into a video game? The idea seemed weird and unintuitive, but we knew we wanted to capture and preserve that same feeling of arguing with your friends. Let’s look at what our Design Director Hal Milton wrote when we first pitched it: SUPERFIGHT Is Made Of People There isn’t an algorithm in the world that can solve for, “Who could win between Captain Picard with Badger Claws and an Eating Disorder versus Captain Kirk with Bubblegum Skin and Pronounced Narcolepsy?” This is a good thing, as Superfight is a game for Humans to play together, not infernal machines. I agreed completely, but what if we used microphones and webcams to help us with this? I watch Twitch regularly — playing Superfight for viewers over the internet seemed like the obvious solution. In a short time, we built a prototype that let people vote on Twitch and Twitter while watching a live game of Superfight played with physical cards. If we could pull that off, we thought, the other pieces should fall in to place. What’s Stream First? Superfight is a Stream First game — a game designed with live streaming at its core. Superfight is built with three groups in mind. Let’s talk about PVB (Players, Viewers, & Broadcasters): · Player — You’re playing Superfight with your friends. It’s fun. · Viewer — People watching Superfight on Twitch. You may be part of a Broadcaster’s community. You’re watching AND you’re engaging the game alongside the players. · Broadcaster — You’re streaming Superfight live. You’re a player too, but now you’re involving your viewers and community. To make a Stream First game, you have to stream it, which is why we immediately approached Twitch streamers for their help. We listened to them play, and watched them interact with each other and their audiences. We observed and asked questions. Players, Viewers, and Broadcasters all had input, and depending on what happened during the game, all three groups had a different perspective. Your Twitch Identity. As a Viewer and a Broadcaster, your Twitch identity is important. In order for the game to broadcast to your channel, detect votes, and count votes — players must link Superfight to their Twitch account. Your Twitch identity helps Superfight track all the interactions you have with the game. Once you start Superfight, remember to link your Twitch ID! Playing the Game, but… Not IN the Game. One of the fun things about Superfight is that you’re earning rewards while watching on Twitch. Here’s how it works: Each time you vote, you earn Experience Points and cards. These votes are tracked and when you eventually log in to Superfight using your Twitch account we reward you with all of the Experience Points and cards you’ve accrued. Vote on games during your lunch break at work, and get rewards when you log in at home! Not just useful for feedback, these broadcasts were also playtests. We paid close attention to everyone involved, and balanced our game and feedback to assist all players. Remember those rewards viewers got for voting on streams? They’ve been earning them since our Alpha, when we began streaming the game weekly. Players receive rewards for their time spent watching our test Streams when they finally open Superfight. Where Do We Go From Here? You can pick up Superfight TODAY — you can find it on Steam. It’s been a long road since we first prototyped the game and now we’re launching. There have been a lot of lessons learned and many more to come. We set out to make Superfight an experience unlike most online games. Gameplay centered around verbal arguments with a live audience seems like a scary thing. However after spending so much time with broadcasters, their communities, and Twitch, I’ve found that Superfight is well on its way to bringing players, viewers, and broadcasters even closer together.',893,'Stream First, Fight Next: A Superfight Story','

	('/en/2016/06/27/introducing-cheering-celebrate-together-da62af41fac6/','Jun 27, 2016 - By Robin Fontaine. Introducing Cheering: Celebrate, together. Update: As of Sept 19, the Cheering beta now includes: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Israel, Lithuania, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, US Outlying Islands, UK, and US. Update on June 28: Follow up FAQ. When we watch Twitch, we feel surrounded by people who understand something that many just don’t. And when amazing things happen on stream, there’s no one else we’d rather celebrate with. The moments we share on Twitch, and the streamers who create them, are the glue that binds us together. So now, we are happy to introduce a new way for us to celebrate and support streamers together: Cheering. Cheering is a new way to show support for streamers and celebrate the moments you love with the community, all right in chat. A Cheer is a chat message that uses Bits, which are evolving animated emotes that you can buy. Bits emotes can be used one by one, all at once, or anywhere in between. Using many at once shows more support and creates cooler emotes! Bits emotes can be used anywhere in a chat message by typing”cheer” followed by a number, ex. cheer33 or cheer255. Here’s how it works… Cheering shows your support for the partner just like subscriptions do, and as you Cheer in a channel, you earn Cheer Chat Badges for that channel so that your support is recognized. Cheering is launching today in beta, which means this is just the beginning and you’ll see more cool stuff for Cheering in the months to come. You can try it out in participating channels: lirik, Summit1G, DansGaming, towelliee, ProfessorBroman, KingGothalion, ActaBunniFooFoo, Tinadayton, JoshOG, GiantWaffle, Bacon_Donut, StreamerHouse, camgears, Nightblue3, PauseUnpause, BrownMan, SirhcEz, crisheroes, nairomk, MANvsGAME, pianoimproman, VernNotice, TimTheTatman, JonSandman, strippin, Dexteritybonus, AnneMunition, Witwix, Sacriel, samzorz, reynad27, Ellohime, Trick2g, GassyMexican, hsdogdog, savjz, hyphonix, iwilldominate, hiko, sjow, liquidtlo, djWHEAT, Aureylian, slin, Frodan, twitch_scar, nerolabs, cheer2play, CohhCarnage, lifewithlaughs, Sevadus, trihex, brotatoe, Vieparlafoi, Swiftor, OMGitsfirefoxx, CobaltStreak, iKasperr, FutureManGaming, itmejp, jacklifear, Ezekiel_III, IIJERiiCHOII, richard_hammer, EatMyDiction1, GoldGlove, Femsteph, lolRenaynay. To get started, buy some Bits by clicking on the Bits icon that appears in the chat message window, just to the left of the emote button. We’re so excited to bring this new experience to Twitch, and we hope you’ll join us in support, celebration, and Cheering, together. Burning questions: Q. What are some of the benefits of Cheering? A. If you’ve ever watched Twitch and wanted to show support, but you couldn’t do it the way you wanted, now you can Cheer. You can Cheer if you’re a channel subscriber or if you aren’t. You can Cheer using any number of Bits you like, whenever you want. You can start Cheering right when things get interesting, or you can Cheer when a moment is dying down to keep the train going. Plus, you earn Cheer Chat Badges as you Cheer. Even if you aren’t the Cheering type, you can still benefit from Cheering on Twitch. Cheer Chat Badges will help you identify the regulars in new channels, animated emotes will draw your attention to important messages or moments, and since Cheering is in chat, streamers and their moderators can make sure that the Cheering in their channel is right for their community. Q. What do the Bits emotes and Cheer Chat Badges look like: Q. Does Cheering support third-party integrations? A. Absolutely! Third parties can build cool stuff around Cheering through chat messages and through our PubSub system. REST API support is forthcoming. Q. When will Twitch make Cheering available for all partners? A. As soon as we can! Our goal is to make Cheering a great experience for streamers and viewers alike. During the beta period, we’ll be gathering feedback and making improvements, which is much easier to do on a smaller scale. We’re excited about the future of Cheering, and we’re looking forward to making it more widely available as soon as it’s ready. Q. What payment methods can I use to buy Bits? A. Bits are purchased via Amazon Payments. We leveraged Amazon’s payment technology so that we could make Cheering available sooner, and with more features. We’re working hard to make Bits and Cheering awesome, and that includes adding additional local payment methods and currency support in the future. Q. What if I have a question that wasn’t answered here? A. First, go our Help Center article on Cheering for more details. If you don’t see your answer there, you can ask a question.',767,'Introducing Cheering: Celebrate, together.','

	('/en/2016/03/02/update-chat-replay-is-now-live-aac0b82305b6/','Mar 2, 2016. Update: Chat Replay is Now Live! Starting today, all videos made after we started capturing chat messages on February 23rd will include Chat Replay right alongside the video. Now, when a chicken wing-loving puppet plays Diablo III or there’s a blindfolded attempt at completing Super Mario 64 you’ll know the exact moments that made Twitch Chat go wild. And if you want to get really meta, check out last week’s Twitch Weekly talking about Chat Replay — now with Chat Replay. Whoa. For the full scoop on Chat Replay, read below and check out the Chat Replay FAQ for more info. Originally posted on February 23, 2016. Watching recorded video on Twitch is about to get a whole lot better, and a whole lot more like a live experience! Over the next few weeks we will be rolling out Chat Replay, a new feature that brings the excitement of Twitch Chat to recorded videos. Now, when you watch a recorded stream or highlight, the chat from the live broadcast will show up right next to the video. Never again will you wonder which moments had the chat going wild or what messages your favorite broadcaster is responding to. With Chat Replay, you can fully immerse yourself in the Twitch viewing experience and relive the best moments from broadcasts exactly as they happened live. Starting today, we will begin capturing chat messages from live streams, and chat messages will be gradually added to recorded videos over the next few weeks. Chat Replay messages will display alongside videos as long as they are available on Twitch. This includes Sub notifications, Emotes, and Badges exactly as they appeared on the live stream. If you already use the browser extension, ReChat, you’ll be happy to know that Chat Replay brings all the same functionality (and more!) directly into Twitch, and was developed with input from its creator, Nils Caspar, who officially joined the Twitch team last year. Chat Replay also has moderation features built directly into the interface. Messages deleted due to user time-outs or bans during a live stream will not appear in Chat Replay, but, since channel moderators can’t always catch everything when it happens, anyone with permission to moderate a particular channel will also be able to delete individual chat messages from that channel’s recorded videos. Stay tuned over the coming weeks as Chat Replay is added to videos made starting today. To learn more about Chat Replay and moderation functions, check out the Chat Replay FAQ.

To better define our Moderation teams, notably roles and responsibilities, we updated Chat with a new role: Global Moderator. A Global Moderator is basically a Super Channel Moderator: all the privileges of a Channel Moderator across all channels on the site. Global Moderators are volunteers who have extensive experience and knowledge of all things Twitch. We hope you’ll say hi to them and look to them for advice and support. That icon is pretty bad axe. A reminder that Administrators, or “Admins” for short, are paid personnel who review grief reports and enforce our Terms of Service. In short, they help us keep Twitch safe and fun. For more on chat badges and what they represent, read this. FAQ. How can I become a Global Moderator or Admin? First, make sure to say your prayers and eat your vitamins. Second, we add to our volunteer or paid corps on an as-needed basis. There aren’t always openings. We’ll post on Twitter (@TwitchSupport) when we’re looking for more folks. So make sure to have your Twitch resume/CV and referrals ready when the time comes! Does this change the Channel Moderator role? (AKA, Does this mean I’m now a Global Moderator?). No. This role is a new, separate role from the Channel Moderator role. The Channel Moderator does not change. This new role is effectively a Channel Moderator in all channels. The badge is a darker green and an axe to convey the extension of this role from the existing Channel Moderator role (lighter green and a sword).',270,'Chat Update: New Global Moderator Role and Badge','

Name, serial number, position, and when you started at Twitch. Hello! I’m John Rizzo and I work at Twitch as a Senior Software Engineer. My first day was on December 9, 2013, though it’s amazing to see how much the company has grown in the short time since I joined! (Editor’s note: We don’t have serial numbers. We just have watches we can’t take off.). Where were you prior to starting at Twitch? Before Twitch, I worked at a startup called imo where I worked on a chat system and social discovery network. Before imo, I had internships at Google and IBM. When you’re not at the office, you’re… Rock climbing, watching a movie, playing music, or watching/streaming on Twitch! Where did you hear about Twitch/your position at Twitch? I was an active Twitch viewer and streamer for about a year before deciding to apply for a position at Twitch. I was able to experience first-hand how Twitch connects gamers across the world and is helping esports rapidly grow into a mainstream form of entertainment. When I decided it was time for me to consider a new job, it was a no-brainer to apply to Twitch. What do you do at Twitch/what does your typical day look like? I currently work on chat system. My average day consists of designing and implementing software which lets us handle the highest-volume chat rooms in the world, and making our user’s chat experience excellent. A lot of my time is spent programming, though much of it is spent thinking about systems design and discussing problems/solutions with other Twitch engineers (though I take breaks to do some gaming with other Twitch employees!). My last two weeks have been spent redesigning and reimplementing the part of our chat system that handles the viewer list and displaying moderator/staff/admin badges next to messages. If I was told a year ago that I would have such a huge role in improving the chat system I’d spent so much time interacting with, I probably wouldn’t have believed it. What’s the best part about working for Twitch? There are so many great things about working at Twitch that it’s hard to choose just one, but I love the engineering culture at Twitch — everyone is passionate about the company and the product, and the team is so small such that everyone has a huge impact. The quality of the team and culture is so excellent that it’s difficult to see from the outside looking in — I had to experience it first-hand to appreciate it (cough we’re hiring cough cough). What’s your favorite perk at Twitch? This is another area where it’s difficult to pick one favorite thing — it’s a toss-up between all the gaming equipment around the office I can play on versus the free monthly massages. What helps Twitch stand out amongst other startups in the City? We’re nurturing a new form of sport/hobby into the mainstream, and our culture reflects that. As our CEO Emmett Shear stated in a recent interview, “We want you to feel as if you’ve stepped into a corner of the internet”, and our culture really makes employees feel like they’re incubating this new area of entertainment by living it on a daily basis. It’s kind of an intangible thing, but we can just “feel” that what we’re doing will make a long-lasting impact on entertainment and socialization — it’s a very exciting thing to be a part of. What advice would you give to someone looking to join the engineering team at Twitch? Love what you do and always be improving yourself. Our engineering team spends a great deal of effort to improve our internal processes, tools, and way of thinking about how to do things the right way rather than rushing code out the door. This kind of thinking requires a dedicated mindset focused towards taking on responsibility and improving yourself, the team, and the company. Never settle for “good enough”!

They’ll bring their unique blend of gaming know-how and humor to the Feb. 6 event at the Hard Rock Las Vegas Hotel and Casino. Fans across the globe also will have a chance to check out the co-hosts live at the D.I.C.E. Awards and catch some of their favorite game developers participating in the two-day 2014 D.I.C.E.

Awards this year with Freddie Wong,” said Felicia Day. “I presented in 2012 and got a really cool t-shirt, so who knows what I’ll bring home this year. Maybe Randy Pitchford in a suitcase.” “I’ve been practicing reading off a homemade teleprompter, with the goal of not embarrassing myself in a room full of nerds,” said Freddie Wong. “I’m excited to co-host with Felicia and hope my two days of self-imposed hosting practice will pay off.” “The D.I.C.E. week is about The New Golden Age, and Felicia and Freddie’s respective work very much reflects this theme as they have become true trailblazers in the expanding world of web-based video. They are a perfect fit for the stage as they are gamers at heart who will not only entertain, but also celebrate and honor our industry’s game makers and creative visionaries,” said Martin Rae, president, Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences. “Twitch has been a fantastic partner and we are looking forward to re-engaging with their audience to share the stellar sessions and Awards show that have defined our organization.” “We have more than 100 publishers and developers using Twitch to generate excitement and build communities around their games, so having the D.I.C.E. Summit on our platform really complements the trend and is a great honor,” said Matthew DiPietro, VP of Marketing, Twitch. Felicia Day is a professional actress who has appeared in numerous mainstream television shows and films, currently recurring on the CW show “Supernatural”, and recently completing a two-season arc on the SyFy series “Eureka”. However, Felicia is best known for her work in the web video world, behind and in front of the camera. She co-starred in Joss Whedon’s Internet musical “Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog,” which was ranked in the “Top 10 Best TV of 2008” by Time Magazine, Entertainment Weekly and People Magazine and won an Emmy in 2009. She also created and starred in the hit web series “The Guild.” “The Guild” has won numerous awards for web video excellence, garnering a Producers Guild Awards nomination for best web series in 2011. She has expanded the brand into numerous merchandizing opportunities, including a hit comic book series with Dark Horse Comics. Her production company Knights of Good produced the innovative web series “Dragon Age” in conjunction with EA/Bioware in 2011 and she later co-founded a digital entertainment network called Geek & Sundry. Since launching in April of 2012, its YouTube channel has garnered more than 800,000 subscribers and more than 75 million views. Freddie Wong has placed himself as one of the pioneers in online video, bringing professional premium content to the YouTube platform with his channel, FreddieW. His uniquely crafted, mind bending viral videos have spread across the global web making Freddie the #1 most subscribed video director on YouTube with over 900 million views since the channel’s inception in April 2010. Video Game High School, his flagship web series, gained over 50 million cumulative views over 12, 15-minute episodes in 2012. Video Game High School 2 retuned the YouTube viewership trend by receiving over a 90% completion rate on 6 episodes of 30-minute content.
